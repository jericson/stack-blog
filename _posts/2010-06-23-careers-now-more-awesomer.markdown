[Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) has always been close to our heart, but we haven't always been able to give it the attention we wanted to give it. No longer! We now have a [dedicated development team](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/new-hires-in-new-york/) _and_ a dedicated sales team working tirelessly to make Careers the best place on the internet for programmers to find great jobs and for employers to find great programmers.

The sales team has been busy. As of this writing we have **351** jobs listed:

Earlier today it was 347 and by the time you read this it may well be more. Contrast that with only 74 jobs back in January!

The dev team has been busy too. We rolled out some changes yesterday:

We consolidated jobs.stackoverflow.com and careers.stackoverflow.com under one domain -- [http://careers.stackoverflow.com/](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) -- gave Careers a brand new look, and added search controls to the home page so you can quickly find the jobs you're looking for.

We added keyword search, improved location based searching and integrated the search controls into the page so you can search and scan in the same place. We also added a preview line to the listings so it's easier to decide what jobs you'd want to look at.

And finally, we added some controls to the job detail page to make it easier to navigate between jobs.

The next step is to **make it easier for employers to post and manage jobs**. After that is done we'll turn our attention over to the CV filing and searching. And after that is done we'll think of some other great things to do, no doubt with your help -- keep the feedback coming [in the [careers] tag on meta.stackoverflow.com!](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/careers)

For careers, success equals something like [number of candidates] x [number of employers] x [number of jobs]. We'll keep investing in Careers, by building more and better functionality for you and by selling more services to more employers, until we are synonymous with the best way to find an awesome job or a world class programmer -- or sysadmin, or QA tester, or UX designer, or ...
