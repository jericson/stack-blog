Welcome to the Stack Overflow Podcast #95 recorded Thursday, November 17, 2016 at Stack Overflow HQ in NYC. Our sponsor today is [double-entry bookkeeping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system). Invented in 1494 in Milan by Leonardo da Vinci's lover, probably. Conveniently enough, that's Jay's new title!

In this week's rant, the gang discusses [Microsoft Connect(); // 2016](https://connectevent.microsoft.com/) where Channel 9 premiered a video featuring our very own David Fullerton, George Beech, and Nick Craver in which they discuss SQL Server and how it impacts [Stack Overflow Enterprise](https://business.stackoverflow.com/enterprise). Also, Microsoft has now joined the Linux Foundation; Google has joined the .Net steering committee; and Visual Studio is available for Mac. What?!? We are now officially living in the Upside Down. 

Our Developer Story today is [Jewelbots](http://www.jewelbots.com/) CEO (and friend to Stack Overflow) Sara Rey Chipps! Jewelbots (launching this week!) are programmable friendship bracelets designed to spark girls’ (and boys’!) interest in coding. Jewelbots are the first of their kind - an open source wearable device where kids dictate the functionality. Sara and Jay discuss the importance of making programmable things that girls are actually interested in instead of just taking a pre-existing product and turning it pink, as well as the challenges of actually making hardware. "Physics are real."

Additionally, we have a One-Minute Tech Review (it's the new [Macbook Pro 2016](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/?afid=p238%7Cs9ziWM6zM-dc_mtid_20925top39173_pcrid_154335371021_&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-mac-slid-) and Joel has a lot to say about that missing ESC key, among other new "features") and another installment of "Startup or Shut Up" where *spoiler alert* Jay actually gets one right! 

This week's constitution question is: Is it ok to get a mechanical keyboard with loud "clicky" keys when you are sharing an office? This is called the [Jason Punyon](https://twitter.com/JasonPunyon) amendment, because of reasons. Post your answer to Twitter using the hashtag #stackoverflowpodcast, with either PRO if yay, or CON if nay, along with your explanation. Keep it short but convincing! The funniest explanation, whether on the winning side or the losing side, will be read on next week's podcast and win a fabulous STACK OVERFLOW STICKER. We also need new amendments, so tweet us your ideas and we could name an amendment after you!

Last week's winner, replying to the question "Should you be allowed to comment out code and check it in?" is @Joe_Stetch!

"CON, this dark road leads to being featured on an episode of 'Hoarders.'" - [@Joe_Stetch](https://twitter.com/joe_stech/status/798769080421400576)

We will not have a podcast for the next two weeks because of the holidays, but look for us the second week of December.
