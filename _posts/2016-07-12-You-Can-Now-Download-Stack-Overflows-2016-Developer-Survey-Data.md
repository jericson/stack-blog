Earlier this year we released the results of our annual developer survey. With more than 50,000 responses fielded from 173 countries, it was the largest and most comprehensive survey of the programmer workforce that has ever been conducted. Now, you can analyze this year’s and previous years’ results yourself by downloading the raw data from our brand new [research portal](http://stackoverflow.com/research). 

Our annual surveys ask developers what they’re up to, what tech they care about most, and what they want. This year, for instance, we found that [JavaScript remains the most popular programming language in the world](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-popular-technologies), [46% of developers don’t have a bachelor’s in computer science or a related field](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education), and [job satisfaction is highly correlated with pushing code to production](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#work-checking-in-code). 

While we like to think we know software developers better than anyone, we’re eager (and curious) to see what you come up with in your own analysis of the data. The launch of our new research site means you can compare what developers have said about the state of the programming world and workforce since 2011. 

You’ll be able to answer questions about how technology preferences have changed over time, whether particular demographics correlate with certain developer job types, and even what programmers think of Stack Overflow.

If you do find something interesting while digging through the data, [let us know on Meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/). And if you’re ambitious enough to make it an academic paper, [we’d love to add it to our collection](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134495/academic-papers-using-stack-exchange-data/134496#134496). Finally, if you’re curious about adding even more data related to Stack Exchange sites, check out [our Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2016/06/learn-more-about-your-site-with-the-se-data-explorer-heres-how/), designed to make it easy to query and browse the public data we periodically release for all Stack Exchange sites.

Happy data diving!
