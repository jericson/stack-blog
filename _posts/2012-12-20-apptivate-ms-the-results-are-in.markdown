After almost three months, Apptivate - [the application development contest collaboration between Stack Overflow and Microsoft](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/apptivate-ms-a-windows-8-app-development-contest/) - has come to an end.

Let's get to the big news right off the bat. Congratulations to our two Apptivate.MS Grand Prize Winners: [Piano Time](http://apptivate.ms/apps/130/piano-time) and [Layout](http://apptivate.ms/apps/111/layout)!

Congratulations to Piano Time and Layout!



[Layout](http://apptivate.ms/apps/111/layout) is a powerful tool for interaction design that makes prototyping in the early stages of development and design a breeze. [Piano Time](http://apptivate.ms/apps/130/piano-time) is a multitouch piano keyboard for your Surface or other Windows 8 tablet device. (It also supports using your keyboard as, well, a keyboard.) It includes recording and playback, a metronome, a learning mode, and more.

As grand prize winners, these two apps win a **$5,000 cash prize**! They will also be featured in [MSDN Flash](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa570311.aspx) and on the [DevRadio](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/DevRadio) show, and they will be promoted by Microsoft throughout the developer community.

The grand prize winners came from a pool of 15 finalists and were chosen by a panel made up of Stack Overflow's own **Joel Spolsky** and **David Fullerton**, as well as Microsoft developer evangelists **Doris Chen** and **Jeff Brand**. There was some stiff competition for the judges to choose from, and we congratulate [all of our finalists](http://apptivate.ms/semi-finals). They won't be going home empty-handed, either - along with the winners of the Reviewer Sweepstakes, they'll go home with some great prizes, too. The first place winners from each category group win a Surface plus a $500 cash prize. The second and third place winners go home with good stuff, too. Johnny, tell 'em what they've won!

And _you_ get a Surface! And _you_ get a Surface! EVERYONE gets a Surface!




The 15 finalists came from a pool of 50 semi-finalists, which in turn came from the list of over 300 fully eligible submissions to Apptivate. Some more stats about the event:



	
  * There were 456 apps submitted overall, including deleted and ineligible apps

	
  * The third week of November was the best week for app submission, with 49 apps coming in that week

	
  * Apptivate users posted 2646 questions and answers in the [windows-8] and [microsoft-metro] Stack Overflow tags

	
  * Over the course of the event, 3163 users voted (on apps or on comment threads) 7454 times


That's all for Apptivateâ€¦ in 2012! The response to this was so positive, we're already on the lookout for similar collaborations in the new year... So stay tuned!
