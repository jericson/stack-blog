Ever notice how [most sites run by programmers have the worst designs ever?](http://weblogs.asp.net/jeff/archive/2004/11/09/254664.aspx)



Yeah.



We're currently at the stage where we need to implement an actual design -- for which I have **recruited actual designers**. Here's a sneak peek at the beta design we're furiously working on implementing at the moment.

And even earlier:

Trust me, you do _not_ want to see the "programmer" design we had before this. I'll have more details on the designer we're working with -- who will be featured in our site's about page credits as well -- later.



This is **by no means final, so feel free to comment**, but it is definitely good enough for the beta to begin next week.
