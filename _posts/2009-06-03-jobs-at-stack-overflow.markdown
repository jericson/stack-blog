You may have noticed we now have a **small job ad in the sidebar**:



[![stack-overflow-job-ad](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JiccF.png)](http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/)



This takes you to [jobs.stackoverflow.com](http://jobs.stackoverflow.com) or, [jobs.serverfault.com](http://jobs.serverfault.com). If these job boards look ... _familiar_, there's a reason.



Since Joel and I are already in bed together (figuratively! _figuratively!_) it makes sense to combine our efforts in the jobs area rather than duplicate work. The last thing I wanted to do was create **Y**et **A**nother **J**ob **N**etwork. Any responsible programmer would resist this, anyway, because of [Curly's Law](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000805.html) and DRY.



I've always admired the [Joel on Software job boards](http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/), with their integrated Joel Testtm. I've referred many people there over the last few years, including my previous employer. Why not [combine these two great tastes that taste great together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWMM7HPeTHQ)?



So if you're looking for a gig, or you know a company that's looking for stellar programmers and/or system administrators, **head on over to [jobs.stackoverflow.com](http://jobs.stackoverflow.com) or [jobs.serverfault.com](http://jobs.serverfault.com)**.



That said, this is just a _start_ on the careers front. We have some more innovative things we are working on in this area that we hope to roll out in the next 6 to 8 weeks. Like, say, wouldn't it be cool if your CV listed the stuff programmers _really_ care about, such as [your first computer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/102714/what-was-your-first-home-computer) ...
