Welcome to Stack Exchange Podcast #57, recorded Friday April 11, 2014 with your hosts Jay Hanlon, David Fullerton, and Joel Spolsky. Today's podcast is brought to you by the Heartbleed bug.

We have lots to talk about (which makes Joel scared), starting with **Community Milestones** (after we discuss 2048 strategy, that is)!



	
  * [Expats](http://expats.stackexchange.com/) is newly in public beta. It's a site for people that are dealing with the bureaucratic messes involved in living outside your home country. [Check out their top-voted questions](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes).

	
    * [Can I lose my US citizenship for accepting employment within a foreign government?](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/146/can-i-lose-my-us-citizenship-for-accepting-employment-with-a-foreign-government)

	
    * [How do I deal with PPACA ("Obamacare") as an expatriate?](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/3/how-do-i-deal-with-ppaca-obamacare-as-an-expatriate-us-citizen)

	
    * [How to build credit history in the USA?](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/118/how-to-build-credit-history-in-the-usa)

	
    * [Tax residency when in the EU for less than 6 months](http://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/143/where-can-i-be-tax-resident-when-i-dont-stay-in-any-eu-country-longer-that-6-mo)




	
  * And we've added yet another math site to the network: [Math Educators](http://matheducators.stackexchange.com/).

	
  * [Graphic Design](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/) has graduated from public beta, and it now has its own beautiful design - check it out! (It's a great site, but it also helps Jay do [things like this](http://imgur.com/OKVS5jx).)


That brings us to our **Community of the Week**: [Information Security](http://security.stackexchange.com/). (For the record: horses _can_ live in barns.) Info Security has gotten a lot of traffic lately thanks to our sponsor, the Heartbleed bug. (We wonder if we're spelling "security" wrong for a while before we realize the site is down. So we'll come back to this.)

Aaaanyway... let's talk about **New Features**.



	
  1. The iOS app is going to come out in the next 6-8 weeks, but you can still [sign up to test it for us](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/228422/stack-exchange-ios-app-nearing-beta) if you have an iPhone.

	
  2. Also, we did an April Fool's prank about unicoins.

	
  3. We're making some changes to the Community Wiki system.Â [There's a blog post here](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/putting-the-community-back-in-wiki/) if you'd rather fast forward through Jay's explanation.

	
  4. We're also making changes to how protecting questions works, and we've [published a set of guidelines](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/changes-and-guidelines-for-the-protected-question-status/) for how to use that feature.


That finishes the New Features segment... except for the other new features we're going to talk about. Breaking news: we're overhauling the profile page. (Stick with us in this part to hear Joel get bored and start talking about emo kid piercings!) There's a very outdated mockup [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226177/the-profile-page-is-getting-a-makeover).

Then, Joel gets so bored he brings up sports. On purpose. Several times. Also: [this is what a Yugo looks like](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Zastava_Yugo_311_1116cc.jpg).

**MOVING ON.** The gang invents a new game, and plays it for a while. Could this be a recurring segment? Tune in next week to find out! For now, we've killed enough time that Info Security is back online, so we'll talk about it for a while.



	
  * [How exactly does the OpenSSL TLS heartbeet (Heartbleed) exploit work?](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55116/how-exactly-does-the-openssl-tls-heartbeat-heartbleed-exploit-work)

	
  * [Don't understand how my mum's Gmail account was hacked](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52115/dont-understand-how-my-mums-gmail-account-was-hacked)

	
  * [How does changing your password every 90 days increase security?](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4704/how-does-changing-your-password-every-90-days-increase-security)


Thanks for joining us during this very productive hour of your life for Stack Exchange Podcast #57, brought to you by Heartbleed - the first buffer overflow bug with a website, a logo, and a marketing department.
