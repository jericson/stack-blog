The Community Team's first and most important job [is to help you, the users](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99338/who-are-the-community-managers-and-what-do-they-do/99341#99341). Every day, we hang out on meta sites and in chat, watching to make sure that [someone is working on your problems](http://stackoverflow.com/error). Until very recently, community managers also fielded each and every request that came through our [support ticketing system](http://stackoverflow.com/contact).

(And before *that*, Jeff Atwood handled them all. The whole team@ inbox, [singlehandedly](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61142/about-your-fing-website).)

Our approach to customer service via email has changed as the network has grown: we've tried many new processes and tools over the years to help community managers handle team@ efficiently and still have brainpower left over for the rest of their jobs. (If you're curious about it, you can take a look at [Jon Ericson's ongoing blog series](http://jericson.github.io/tag/support.html).) But still, support tickets stack up and all too often lose out to more pressing issues on the sites themselves; more and more often, we found ourselves struggling to resolve problems as they came in, much less [fix them in two ways](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html).

Some companies respond to this problem by just giving up, hiding support emails and shunting requests into a poorly-monitored forum somewhere. We know this because we've *repeatedly gotten emails* from members of such sites, from people searching desperately to find *anyone willing to help.* But we don't believe in treating our users - the people whose patronage we depend on - as annoyances to be brushed off and forgotten. So we decided to double down on our commitment to friendly and efficient user support: we've hired two new staff members to handle email support full-time. And we hired them *from the communities they will be supporting*. 

##Please join me in welcoming our two new Community Growth Operations Specialists

### Kyle, aka animuson:
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/89201/animuson"><img title="profile for animuson" src="http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/89201.png" alt="profile for animuson" width="208" height="58" /></a>  

Kyle was [an elected moderator on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/election/4), spending a significant amount of his time helping out others on the site. Some personal background:

* He visited Australia for 18 days as a student, which is probably longer than you've ever spent in Australia (unless you live there);
* He plays an obsessive amount (his words) of video games, and has over 100 platinum trophies on the PlayStation Network;
* He previously worked at his county's Election Commission, which is (unintuitively) the most *non*-political job one can have.

### João, aka JNat:
<a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/1399708/jnat"><img title="profile for JNat" src="http://stackexchange.com/users/flair/1399708.png" alt="profile for JNat" width="208" height="58" /></a>  

João was [a pro tempore moderator on Anime &amp; Manga SE](http://meta.anime.stackexchange.com/questions/339/moderator-pro-tem-announcement), contributing greatly to the health and growth of that community. Some personal background:

* He studied Arts in high school and has a masters degree in Architecture and Urbanism, so it should be obvious how he ended up in operations for an internet Q&amp;A community;
* He's Portuguese, so [Gabe](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/08/introducing-gabe-the-smiling-community-manager/) now has some assistance in supporting the needs of [our Portuguese-speaking members](http://pt.stackoverflow.com/). 
* He credits his love for anime and manga with getting him this awesome new job.

You might be thinking: "Wait. *Operations Specialists*? I thought they were just handling emails." But that would be a waste of their considerable talents. Once João and Kyle have tackled team@, there's no telling how many new and efficient ways they'll find to help make our team better at supporting our communities.

If ever you find yourself having to [contact us](http://meta.stackexchange.com/contact), it's likely that these brave souls will be fielding your request. Feel free to say hi, or tell them what the best part of your week has been so far!
