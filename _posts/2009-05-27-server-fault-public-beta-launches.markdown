Q: How do geeks know it's a holiday?

A: Because the Google logo changed.






Yes, [I said we'd launch Server Fault on the 25th](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-nears/), completely missing the fact that the 25th happens to be [Memorial Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day), a major holiday that most businesses observe, at least here in the United States.



Hopefully everyone had a very pleasant Memorial Day holiday, and came back ready to crack their knuckles and get down to **some serious server, networking, and desktop infrastructure business**, yes?

## Because as of today, [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com) is open for public beta!





Tell your **sysadmin** and **IT professional** friends -- [come join us at serverfault.com!](http://serverfault.com)



(and a quick thanks to our friends at [woot!](http://www.woot.com) who sponsored the launch, too)
