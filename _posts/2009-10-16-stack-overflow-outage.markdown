Our apologies for the all-site outage today. According to our Pingdom monitors, we were down from **7:18 PM PST to 9:43 PM PST**. There goes our vaunted envy-of-the-industry three nines uptime guarantee! 



Apparently there was a router meltdown at our ISP, [Peak Internet](http://www.peakinternet.com/business/hosting/colocation-dedicated#). They promised pictures of the (literally?) melted router via an [update on their Twitter account](https://twitter.com/PEAKInternet/status/4908010791). If they come through, I'll post the pictures here for our viewing pleasure.

(not as dramatic as I had hoped, but there are some definite scorch marks around that solder!)



At any rate, if you guys and gals could send a few less fiery packets of network doom to our ISP's routers, we'd appreciate it.
