There will be no podcast this week, because Joel is on a business trip to Korea, apparently at [webappscon](http://www.webappscon.com/2008/). I can't remember his exact words, but they were something along the lines of _"I don't care that the listeners want a new podcast, I am not a monkey who dances for their amusement!"_ I tried in vain to reason with him, but you've heard how he is.

But seriously, **one thing Joel and I want to do in future podcasts is have more guests on the show**. While we of course _loooove_ talking about all things Stack Overflow and Fog Creek, it's also nice to open the floor up a bit and broaden our horizons.



We have a few guests tentatively lined up for future shows through the end of the year:







  * Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman of [Reddit](http://reddit.com)

  * Richard White of [UserVoice](http://uservoice.com)

  * Some of the fine folks who write and code [woot.com](http://www.woot.com/)

  * [Damien Katz](http://damienkatz.net/) of CouchDB

  * [Eric Sink](http://www.ericsink.com/) of SourceGear




I'd like to open the comments up to suggestions. **Who would _you_ like to hear Joel and I talk with on future Stack Overflow podcasts?**



And yes, [Stack Overflow rules do apply](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/) -- the guest does have to be at least peripherally "programming related", in theory anyway. :)
