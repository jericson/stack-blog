You can't fix what you can't measure, so the first thing we did as a part of our [Summer of Love](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/kicking-off-the-summer-of-love/) campaign was try to measure friendliness in an objective and repeatable way. We [gathered](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/07/week-2-of-the-summer-of-love-researching-comments/) 7000 comments from Stack Overflow and submitted them to Mechanical Turk. For each comment, we asked 20 people to rate the comment as Friendly, Unfriendly, or "Neutral/Unclear."




There are different ways of massaging the data, but I do want to give you a flavor for the kind of comments we're talking about when we're talking about unfriendly comments. Here is a snapshot of the complete results, showing comments where 95% of the reviewers rated a comment as unfriendly (warning, if there are any kids in the area, you may want to send them away):

Of course, "friendliness" can be subjective. But when we're talking about making Stack Overflow a friendly place, we're not talking about being terse or even snippy -- we're talking about lighting a bag of dog poo on fire and throwing it at people.




Of 7000 comments submitted, there were 161 that were rated as "unfriendly" by 75% or more of the reviewers… that's about 2.3%. If you browse Stack Overflow for a few minutes, it's likely that you will come across one of these extremely unfriendly comments. Of those 2.3% extremely unfriendly comments, less than 1/5th have been deleted. Most of them are still on Stack Overflow right now.




The "friendliness" situation is much better, mainly because our reviewers tend to universally interpret thank you's as friendly.

Of 7000 comments submitted, 557 were rated as "friendly" by 75% of more of the reviewers.




I think this proves that the methodology is reasonably sound. I think everyone can agree that the Mechanical Turk reviewers, who were shown comments _out of context_ and who probably did not know anything about our site (all they knew was that it was a "programmer's discussion forum"), did, nevertheless, produce results that seem to agree with how we, inside the community, would judge the comments. That gives me confidence that we have a reliable measure of friendliness that we can track.




There's a lot of other interesting stuff in the data, so here's [an Excel workbook containing the raw data and friendliness ratings](/content/StackOverflowFriendlinessData.zip).
