When we [announced the Apptivate.MS competition](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/apptivate-ms-a-windows-8-app-development-contest/) two months ago, we were hoping that a few members of this community would create and submit a few solid Windows 8 apps - forty or fifty, maybe. A hundred if it _really_ went well.

So when we saw all of the high-quality and innovative app submissions that poured in, we were quite frankly blown away. The Stack Overflow community submitted **almost 400 apps**. [See for yourself](http://apptivate.ms/apps)!

Yet again, the Stack Overflow community has _crushed it_.


The quality and size of the submission pool made our next job really, really difficult: narrowing them down to just 50 apps for the semi-finals, ten for each of the following category groups: [Knowledge](http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/1/knowledge), [Games](http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/2/games), [Interest](http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/3/interest), [Work](http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/4/work), and [Social](http://apptivate.ms/apps/groups/5/social). A panel of Stack Exchange judges (appointed by Microsoft) ranked all the submissions based on the following rubric:



	
  * Innovativeness/Creativity (30%)

	
  * Quality of Submission (30%)

	
  * Use of Windows 8 features, such as the live tile display (30%)

	
  * Public Appeal (voting) (10%)






With these criteria in mind, we put together [a killer semi-finalist slate](http://apptivate.ms/semi-finals). You can vote for your three favorite apps in each category group between now and December 16th (23:59 UTC).

The three highest-voted apps in each category group [will win prizes](http://apptivate.ms/contest#developer-contest) no matter what. They'll also be eligible for a $5000 cash grand prize, so cast your votes to ensure that the best app wins the day. Not an altruist? Voting in the semi-finals also makes you eligible for the [reviewer contest](http://apptivate.ms/contest#reviewer-contest).

The three top-voted semi-finalists in each category group will win great prizes!


You can also continue to leave comments on any app, which also gets you entry into the reviewer contest - as well as providing valuable feedback to Windows 8 developers.

The semi-finals voting phase ends December 16th, 2012, so get your votes in now!
