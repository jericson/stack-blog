Thank you to everyone who organized or attended a Stack Overflow meetup! Our [Meetup Everywher](http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/)[e](http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/) community has grown to over 4,400 people in almost 600 cities, and many of those people signed up for meetups in their areas this year. Many meetups were small, but we hope you all had a good time and that those smaller groups had an even better opportunity to get to know each other.

Our official hashtag is #SOmeetup, and we've seen a lot of great pictures and stories on Twitter, Flickr and YouTube so far. If you haven't had a chance to upload yours yet, please do! Take a look at some of what people have shared so far:




## Milan, Italy


The [Milan meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Milano-IT/) was our largest this year with 101 RSVPs to their event! Check out some [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/77777646@N06/sets/72157629570077588/) and write-ups (some of which [are in Italian](http://darthpelo.tumblr.com/post/22041019085)) - the folks at StartMiUp event streamed their event in HD video online.

## New York, NY, USA

The New York City meetup took place in two parts: the first was a series of talks at [Projective Spac](http://www.projective.co/)e (a coworking space on Manhattan's Lower East Side), and the second was socializing over beers and snacks at Onieals on Grand.

The first session's talks provided information on cool new technologies and gave people some conversation topics.

[Bobby Grace](https://twitter.com/#!/bobbygrace) shared knowledge about responsive web design and designing [Trello](https://trello.com/) for multiple devices.

[Kevin Gessner](http://kevingessner.com/) spoke about how [elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)'s database is "magic."

Stack Exchange developer [Matt Sherman](http://stackoverflow.com/users/70613/matt-sherman) taught us how to meet "hot singles" in our area - a.k.a what tech recruiters can learn from online dating.

We had most of the Stack Exchange core developers and Careers developers on site.








## Bangalore, India




[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dZDOQ.png)](https://twitter.com/#!/abkolan/status/196484634891141121)

Here's the agenda our Bangalore group brainstormed on their [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Bangalore-IN/654972/):

1. Agenda/Plan/Activity Announcement or Meetup start

2. Screening tech talk videos.

3. Lightening talks 5 ~ 10 minute presentations about whatever

4. Talk to the Gurus (If there is anyone with more than 5k reputation or any senior programmer) - Share your experience or QA session.

5. Barcamp style - One track - a 'lab' kinda area where people can plugin laptops and show off.

Stack Overflow name tags (shown on the left) helped people get to know each other and allowed them to show off their current amounts of Stack Overflow reputation.

## Paris, France


The Paris meetup was hosted by [DojoBoost](http://www.dojoboost.com/). Though turnout was fairly small, it seems like everyone had a good time and engaged in interesting discussions.
