Happy New Year and welcome to the Stack Overflow podcast #98 recorded Thursday, January 12, 2017 at the Stack Overflow Headquarters in NYC. Today's broadcast is brought to you by [Sydney, Australia](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/). If there are any Australian listeners left after Joel's terrible accent, thank you and we're sorry.

In this episode: Joel rants about travel for the first time ever; Jay explains the [Developer Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/92SGNSF) (launched last week); and the hosts ponder the reason for Connecticut's existence.

This week's Developer Story is prolific programmer, teacher, writer, podcaster and so much more: [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)! In his 3rd appearance on the podcast, Scott recounts some of the earliest inspirations that helped take his life from being "voted most likely to be convicted of white-collar crime" to the success that he is today. Just some of his great advice to us about helping the next generation: 

"Stuff that you might be doing alone, find a kid and do it with that kid. Include them in soldering or in chopping down a tree or putting together a square-foot garden in the backyard. Those are all gifts that we can give to people moving forward." 

As you know, we're preparing a constitution for Stack Overflow. Each week, we bring you a proposal, and you, our listeners, will decide on whether that proposal becomes a part of our new constitution. This week's question: 

**Is it sufficient to close a bug as NOT REPRO or do you have to write some kind of explanation?** 

Listen to the opinions of the hosts, and then post your answer to Twitter using the hashtag #stackoverflowpodcast, with either PRO if yay, or CON if nay, along with your explanation. Keep it short! The funniest explanation, whether winning or losing, will be read on next week's podcast and win an awesome Stack Overflow Sticker. We also need new amendments, so tweet us your ideas and we could name an amendment after you!

Last week's winner, answering the question: The Simonyi Amendment, Shall we bring back [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)? Is:

"YAY but only the real Hungarian notation. Semantics based instead of type based. In Hungarian instead of English."  Thanks [@inka22222](https://twitter.com/inka22222/status/810943653581647873), you win a thing!
