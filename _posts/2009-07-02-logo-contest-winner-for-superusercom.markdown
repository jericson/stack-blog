The [logo design contest for superuser.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/logo-design-contest-for-superuser-com/) is now complete.



The [voting results](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/superuser-com-logo-vote/) helped inform our final decision:



[![superuser-voting-results](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9yuj.png)](http://www.pollsb.com/polls/p2131264-logo_works_best_superuser_com#results)



At the time that screenshot was taken, we had 2,303 votes -- but the relative percentages were remarkably stable over time. Two clear leaders.



The final winner we decided on was [Mogeek](http://www.crowdspring.com/myspring/profile/Mogeek), with [entry #425](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/6__1) (a late entry!). What I liked about this logo is its simplicity, while simultaneously referencing both the classic Mac OS "face" icon, and old-school ASCII art. This entry was _consistently_ cited by my designery pals (and even Joel himself) as one they liked. First prize is worth **$768** or 29 + 28. Congratulations to Mogeek!

A special honorable mention goes out to these entries by [Raul Padilla](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/superuser__99), [haim](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/superuser__16), and [mfourex](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/gallery/03). It was a tough call.



Thanks to everyone who took the time to submit an entry!



Now that we've got a logo and color scheme, the **superuser.com private beta should begin sometime the month**, and any Stack Overflow or Server Fault user with reputation of 200 or more is invited!
