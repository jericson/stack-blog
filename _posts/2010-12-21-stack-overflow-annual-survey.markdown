[As you’ve seen from the site analytics](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-2010-analytics/), Stack Overflow grew significantly in 2010.  We noticed some major technical shifts – more global visitors and an increase in use of Chrome as a web browser.  But, our visitors are more than just their web browser, operating system and screen resolutions, they are real people with real careers – valuable knowledge which isn’t measured by Google.  Some people may ask why we need to do a survey at all – so, taking poetic license on the 5 Whys, here's how we got to the root answer:

We need a [Stack Overflow Annual User Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/StackOverflowSurvey).



	
  1. Why? – To measure our user’s demographics

	
  2. Why? – Potential advertisers judge our site by demographics to see if we fit in with their goals

	
  3. Why? – You'll see more relevant ads increasing the value of our advertising

	
  4. Why? – With more valued advertisers, we can spend more time developing awesome new features

	
  5. Why? – New features create a better user experience, supporting Stack Overflow’s mission to make the internet a better place than we found it.

The results of the survey will be released in a blog post at a future date.  You can also receive the final results sooner– simply provide your email at the end of the survey.  Your responses are kept completely anonymous and tabulated by SurveyMonkey.
