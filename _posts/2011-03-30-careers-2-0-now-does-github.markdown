In our continuing effort to allow awesome developers to demonstrate their …awesomeness… we’ve added the ability to include your [GitHub](https://github.com/) projects on your Careers 2.0 profile.

 

The feature is inspired by a sentiment widely shared among developers and employers: _show me_. As John Resig put it:

[![resigtweet](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWsC2.png)](https://twitter.com/#!/jeresig/status/33968704983138304)

The process is easy. Head over to your [Careers 2.0 profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv), and look for the cute little GitHub guy:

…and two clicks later, your GitHub awesome becomes part of your Careers 2.0 awesome – complete with language tags and time span. We give you the opportunity to explain your work, too.

Careers 2.0 profiles are [invitation-only](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/careers-2-0-launches/). You might get an invitation based on your activity on Stack Overflow, or through a peer who has been granted some invites of their own.

 

If you have some good work on GitHub, but haven’t gotten an invitation from us, just drop us a note at [careers+github@stackoverflow.com](mailto:careers+github@stackoverflow.com) or tweet us [@StackCareers](https://twitter.com/#!/StackCareers) with a hashtag of #github. We’ll check it out!
