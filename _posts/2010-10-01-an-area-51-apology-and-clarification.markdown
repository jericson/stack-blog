We'd like to apologize to the [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com) community. 

Allow me to explain with a diagram:

[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/EOkWT.png)](http://peanuts.com/)

In this diagram:





  * Charlie Brown is the **Area 51 community**.

  * Lucy Van Pelt is **Stack Overflow Internet Services Inc**.

  * The football is the following proposals: [Developer Testing](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/8494/developer-testing-unit-testing-and-more), [Compiler Design](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/7848/compiler-design), and [Vim](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/14187/vi-vim-and-vixens).


As Joel explained in [Merging Season](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/), if ...



>
1. Almost all X questions are on-topic for site Y
2. Y already exists, it already has a tag for X, and nobody is complaining
3. Thereâ€™s a high probability that users of site Y would enjoy seeing the occasional question about X




... then your proposal should be **closed as a duplicate** on Area 51, which has a close reason _precisely for this purpose!_

![](/images/wordpress/area-51-close-duplicate1.png)

Area 51 was always envisioned as a tool for broadening our scope -- for creating new sites serving _new topics_ and answering questions that were _previously considered off-topic_ on [our existing sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites). Area 51 was _never_ intended as a tool for creating overlapping sub-sites that would **cannibalize users** from our existing sites!

We thought we made this clear in the [Area 51 FAQ](http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq), but apparently we didn't.

That said, **it is completely and utterly our fault** that we didn't stay on top of these overlapping proposals and close them as duplicates in a more timely fashion. It was unfair of us to let these proposals advance so far, when it is clear that they -- however well intentioned -- did not meet the spirit or letter of what Area 51 is for.

That is, as the kids say, "not cool." And I would like to apologize on behalf of Stack Overflow Internet Services for failing the community in this way.

Yes, this does mean that these proposals -- and, for that matter, any other proposals that would tend to drain audience away from existing Stack Exchange 2.0 sites -- will be closed as duplicates.

In the future, so we don't make these mistakes again, we plan to institute the following changes:





  * be much more diligent about scrutinizing proposals _as they move to commitment phase_, not months later when they're at 80% commitment.

  * try to build better vote-based tools that can assist proposals in merging together under _broader_ topics so they have a stronger chance of surviving and defining their own unique topic space.

  * strengthen the [tag page support](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/new-tag-info-pages/) in our engine so sub-communities can prosper in a set of tags without feeling that they absolutely must ["break out" into their own site](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/factionalism-site-or-tag/).


We're sorry. But we're only human, and we make mistakes too. Area 51 is something we love and are very excited about, but it's also new to us -- and we're learning about the process as we go along.

We hope you'll stick with it (and us) to see where it goes.
