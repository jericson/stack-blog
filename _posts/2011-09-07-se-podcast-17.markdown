Jeff & Joel are back with guests this week - joining them are [Kyle Brandt](http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt) and [George Beech](http://serverfault.com/users/5880/zypher), our very own sysadmins/ops guys/[insert your own term here]

After a brief test of the emergency broadcast system, we plunge right into the podcast, including:



	
  * Joel is late because he had to go up to AOL HQ to pick up some more floppy disks for the office

	
  * We recently [launched Blog Overflow ](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/)- which was actually a pretty substantial engineering and technical background to making it happen.

	
  * A huge discussion of the the SE infrastructure setup and why we host our own instead of relying on Amazon or another outside provider.  Hint: not only can we roll our own better, [but its a lot cheaper too](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/73969/what-would-stack-exchanges-yearly-expenses-be-if-it-were-to-be-using-a-third-par/73978#73978).

	
  * In the department of little tweaks with big effect, check out our "network apocalypse": at one point, Stack reconfigured to separate different types of network traffic due to [microbursting](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/per-second-measurements-dont-cut-it/) overloading the network - this simple upgrade greatly increased the throughput and efficiency of the existing infrastructure.

	
  * In the good news department: Jeff talks about the [expanding user cards](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/expanding-user-cards/) just introduced and based on a conversation from our [podcast a few weeks ago](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/se-podcast-15/) with [Michael Natkin](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/1393/michael-at-herbivoracious)

	
  * In the bad news department: we've decided to cancel Stack Overflow DevDays due to low ticket sales - you can read [Joel's full blog post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/devdays-2011-is-cancelled/) for all the details.

	
  * Finally, we welcome our newest engineering hire - [Demis](http://stackoverflow.com/users/85785/mythz)!


That's it!  Tune in next week at the usual time for another episode with more guests!
