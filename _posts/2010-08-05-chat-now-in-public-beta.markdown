Our "third place", after a [successful three day beta preview](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/third-place-chat-beta-preview/), is now on the final path to launch.

What is [this mythical third place](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/) I speak of?



## Chat.




    
    
         money.stackexchange.com
    meta.money.stackexchange.com

Because you not only need a place to have **intelligent Q&A; about managing your finances**, you need a place to talk _about_ the place, and a less formal "third place" to collaborate in real time with the fellow members of your community.

This is a **permanent public beta**, meaning chat is now live on _one_ site in our network ... forever. We plan to roll out out chat on more sites in about 4 weeks, assuming the public beta goes reasonably well.

Before visiting this public chat beta, please bear in mind:





  1. You must have a parent site account (in this case, [Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com)) in good standing with at least **20** reputation to talk in the chat.

  2. Before visiting chat, be sure you're logged in at the parent site, because we use that parent cookie to know who you are.

  3. Please read the [chat faq](http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/faq). And if you've already read it, humor me and _read it again_ ... it has changed, and we will continue to improve it during the public beta.

  4. Hop on over to [**chat.meta.stackoverflow.com**](http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com) and get to know the fellow members of your community!


Have fun -- and be sure to leave your feedback for us either on meta in a question [tagged [chat]](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chat), or in the chat itself in the appropriately named ["Chat Feedback" room](http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/rooms/77/chat-feedback).
