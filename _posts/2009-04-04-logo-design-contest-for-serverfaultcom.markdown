Since we had such good [results](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/) from our [previous community logo contest](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest/), we're doing the same thing for [serverfault.com](http://serverfault.com):



We have [a serverfault.com logo design contest at 99 designs](http://99designs.com/contests/20088), with a prize of $29 at stake.

This time I've also **added $50 prizes for second and third place**. I always felt bad that [the logos we didn't pick for Stack Overflow](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/) were so good, and I had nothing to give the designers for their effort. Luckily, our good friend Leon Bambrick stepped in at the last minute with free licenses for [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/), which was a very nice gesture. No disrespect meant to Mr. Bambrick, but I think they'll like the 50 bucks even better. :)



I've noticed that a few of the logo designs that initially appeal to me are thematically matching to Stack Overflow. I like this trend!



To be clear, we plan for stackoverflow.com and serverfault.com to be "sister sites", meaning:







  * they run the same underlying software

  * they support shipping questions back and forth to each other






But each one will have 







  * its own community

  * its own domain name

  * its own set of moderators

  * its own logo

  * its own set of colors and visual style




We will also have a brief (1 week?) beta period, as mentioned before, and all Stack Overflow users with > 200 rep will be invited to participate.
