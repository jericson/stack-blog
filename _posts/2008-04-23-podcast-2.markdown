This is the second episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:


  * Why have a podcast at all? What's the point?

  * A discussion about some the podcasts Joel listens to: [John Dvorak](http://www.crankygeeks.com/), [Adam Curry](http://curry.com/).

  * StackOverflow podcast [transcription wiki](https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/?W4) courtesy of FogBugz

  * New RSS feed at [blog.stackoverflow.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/), with [podcast specific RSS feed](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/?feed=podcast) courtesy of [podpress](http://www.mightyseek.com/podpress).

  * Podcast feed submitted at iTunes, PodCast Alley, Yahoo Podcasts and Podcast Ready.

  * Sound quality concerns (we're working on it).

  * Why we require audio submissions for questions.


We also answered the following listener questions, with a lot of peripheral discussion on related topics:


  1. **Nathan Stohlmann**: How do we plan to keep religious discussions from happening on stackoverflow? will we provide a way to show implementations in multiple languages?

  2. **Matt Youell**: How will we handle spam or reblogged content from stackoverflow? What about licensing issues with user-generated content?

  3. **Andrew Davis**: How will we prevent stackoverflow quality from diminishing over time as the site becomes more popular?

  4. **Andre Bluehs**: Should I learn C++?


If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, 
record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to [podcast@stackoverflow.com](mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com).
