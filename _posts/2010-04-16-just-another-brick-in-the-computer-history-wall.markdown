Stack Overflow is planning to buy a brick in the [Computer History Museum wall](http://www.computerhistory.org/contribute/impression/).



[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdHuw.jpg)](http://www.computerhistory.org/)



It's for a good cause  -- the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/) is one of my favorite places on Earth, and it should be on the [bucket list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bucket_List) of any self respecting computer geek.



But more importantly .. **what should our 6 line, 18 characters per line brick say?**
