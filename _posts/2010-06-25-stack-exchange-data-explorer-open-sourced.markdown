As promised, the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](http://odata.stackexchange.com/) -- a web-based tool for [querying our creative commons data](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/introducing-stack-exchange-data-explorer/) -- **is now open source!**

This is, of course, the project that [our newest Valued Associate, Sam Saffron](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00008/), has been working so hard on over the last 6-8 weeks.



The project is hosted at Google Code in a Mercurial repository:  



## [http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/](http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/)





The SEDE is built using the very same software stack we use on Stack Overflow:







  * jQuery

  * .NET 4.0 C#

  * Visual Studio 2010

  * SQL Server

  * IIS7




You can get started using the completely free [Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/downloads/#2010-Visual-CS).



Check out the [readme.txt](http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/source/browse/Readme.txt) for additional details, or [browse the source](http://code.google.com/p/stack-exchange-data-explorer/source/browse/) through Google Code's web UI.



It was always our hope that **the SEDE could be used as a freely embeddable web tool to teach SQL with a sample dataset** -- and now, the code itself is available to modify, improve, and learn from as well.
