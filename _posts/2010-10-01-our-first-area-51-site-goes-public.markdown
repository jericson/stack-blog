  * Initial Proposal (May 25th)

  * Definition phase (May 25th)

  * Commitment phase (June 14th)

  * Private beta phase (June 30th)

... has just arrived -- as a real live non-beta public site!

## [webapps.stackexchange.com](http://webapps.stackexchange.com) -- Q&A; for power users of web applications



(briefly known as nothingtoinstall.com)

Thanks to our [pro-tem moderators](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/) who helped expertly guide the site through the full public beta period:

This is our first site to make it all the way through the [Area 51 process](http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq) that makes up [Stack Exchange 2.0](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/changes-to-stack-exchange/) from beginning to end, so we're still working out some of the small details.

We're incredibly proud of what the community has accomplished in the **quality of the web applications Q&A;** on [http://webapps.stackexchange.com](http://webapps.stackexchange.com)! We encourage you to check it out, participate, [share great questions with others](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/announcer-booster-and-publicist-badges/) -- and generally let us know what you think!
