I'm very thrilled to announce that Sean Gallagher is joining us as an Art Director. He will be working out of our New York HQ.

OK, that's not Sean. This is [Sean](http://dluxstudios.com/11/).

The process of finding Sean did remind me of  the movie Seven Samurai, where the villagers were looking for aids. I've been looking for design help for a while. Besides excellent web design skills, Sean also has great experience in strategy, conceptual and communications design ranging all media from one-offs to brand campaigns. I believe he'll be a great asset, especially since we've started creating a lot more design materials to promote our Stack Exchange 2.0 sites.

Sean lives in NYC and loves Japanese food and robot toys as much as I do. He's a serious vintage Japanese robo toys collector. Check out his [whole collection](http://www.toybotstudios.com/2011/08/wondrous-vintage-collection-of-diceone.html)!

Welcome aboard Sean!
