A collection of clips recorded at the [San Francisco DevDays conference](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/sanfrancisco/), including Joel Spolsky, Mark Harrison, Jeff Atwood, Scott Hanselman and Rory Blyth. This episode runs a bit longer than usual.






  * [Joel Spolsky](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4/joel-spolsky) on web usability  



  * [Mark Harrison](http://stackoverflow.com/users/116/mark-harrison) on Python and the [Norvig spell checker](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)  



  * [Rory Blyth](http://stackoverflow.com/users/183801/rory-blyth) on iPhone development


  * [Scott Hanselman](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6380/scott-hanselman) on [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) 2.0


  * [Jeff Atwood](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1/jeff-atwood) on Stack Overflow


  * Ad-hoc roundtable podcast with Scott, Rory, Joel, and Jeff backstage at DevDays. Warning: extreme ramblosity ahead!


  * Joel explains his [Duct Tape Programmer](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html) post. Apparently DevDays is a duct tape conference, and this section of the recording is a duct tape podcast.


  * Some discussion of the ubiquity of mobile code. Also, if you are nostalgic for the era "when development was hard", the consensus is that you should be doing mobile development today on iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, or Symbian.


  * Rory elaborates on his experience with (and effusive opinions on)  iPhone development to date. Is coding in Objective-C best accompanied by a flux capacitor, New Coke, and Max Headroom? Also, his excitement for [MonoTouch](http://monotouch.net).


  * Joel and Scott put on their amateur language designer hats and have a spirited discussion of type inference and Fog Creek's in-house DSL, Wasabi.


  * Scott covers some of the highlights of new and shiny features coming in the Visual Studio 2010 IDE, the C# 4.0 language, and the ASP.NET MVC 2.0 web framework.




Our favorite questions this week:






  * [How do I create unicode smileys?](http://superuser.com/questions/52671/how-do-i-create-unicode-smilies-like) So far beyond :) it isn't even funny. Who knows, you might even learn some typography along the way!
