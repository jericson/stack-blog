About six months ago we began work in earnest on the [second version of the Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/).  A few months later, after a short private beta, we [opened up a public beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/12/stack-exchange-api-v2-0-public-beta/) with tantalizing prizes.

Now it's time to announce the winners.

All these users contributed a substantially to the quality of the API by finding and reporting numerous bugs, and will be getting their choice of a Lilliput Mini USB Monitor and a Kindle Touch 3G.


## But wait, there's more!


As part of the new authentication feature in Stack Exchange API V2.0, we added an apps tab on user profiles for managing app permissions.

Up until now, this tab was only visible to users who had authorized at least one application.  Starting today we've made it visible to all users, and put some tasteful app suggestions in there for users who haven't authorized any apps yet.

[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBDdN.png)](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/04/stack-exchange-api-v2-0-contest-winners/featured-apps/)

We're doing this to help those developers who build on our API find an audience for their hard work, in a similar vein to [Community Promotion Ads](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/community-promotion-ads/).

Here are the current guidelines for getting an app listed:



	
  * It must be free, and thus available to all our users

	
  * It must be listed on [Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/?tab=apps)

	
  * It must work on all Stack Exchange sites

	
  * It must be awesome (we're hand curating these for now)




# Congratulations to all the winners


You should definitely check them out.

If none of these apps float your boat there are plenty more [available on Stack Apps](http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/app), or you could [jump in and build your own](https://api.stackexchange.com/).
