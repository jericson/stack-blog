Windows 8 officially launches on October 26th, and it’s already generating quite a few [questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/windows-8).  So when Microsoft approached us about sponsoring an app development contest, we thought it was a great idea.

Today we’re announcing [Apptivate.ms](http://apptivate.ms/), a Windows 8 App Development Contest sponsored by Microsoft.

The contest has two parts:



	
  1. A **Developer Contest** for people interested in writing applications

	
  2. A **Reviewer Contest** for people interested in reviewing and voting on apps


You can participate - and win prizes - in both categories, so even if you aren’t interested in developing your own app you can still participate by helping others by reviewing their submissions.




# Developer Contest


The Developer Contest awards prizes for the best apps in 5 broad Groups: Knowledge, Games, Interest, Work, and Social.  Here’s how it works:

	
  1. **Create a Windows 8 app** and submit it to Apptivate.MS by December 6

	
  2. The top 10 apps in each Group (chosen by judges, with input from your initial votes) will advance to the semi-final round December 7 - 9

	
  3. **Vote** on the best apps between December 10 - 16.  The top 3 voted apps in each category will win the **Voter’s Choice Prizes**.

	
  4. One winner will be chosen by the Stack Exchange and Microsoft judges to win the **Grand Prize** on December 19


Two Grand Prize winners* will be awarded:


### **$5,000 Cash Grand Prize**




### **+ Feature in MSDN Flash and Microsoft’s DevRadio**




### **+ Promotion in Microsoft’s User Community**


The top 3 apps in each category will win a **Voter’s Choice Prize**:

### 5 first-place winners: **$500 + Tablet running Windows RT**




### 5 second-place winners: **Tablet running Windows RT**




### 5 third-place winners: **Windows 8**


**Submit early and often.**  Your first submission doesn’t have to be final -- in fact, you’re encouraged to submit early and get feedback to develop your app further.  The votes will be reset for the semi-final round so everyone can vote on your final submission.

See the full [Rules, Terms & Conditions](http://apptivate.ms/contest#rules-terms-conditions) and the [Submission Guidelines](http://apptivate.ms/apps/guidelines) on Apptivate.ms for more information.



# **Reviewer Sweepstakes**


Not developing an app? You can still help by leaving comments on apps, asking and answering [Windows 8-related questions](http://apptivate.ms/questions) on Stack Overflow, and participating in the Windows 8 Developer Chats.

See the [Contest page](http://apptivate.ms/contest#reviewer-contest) for a full list of achievements that can be unlocked on Apptivate.ms.  Each achievement (up to 30) gives you an entry into one of the reviewer sweepstakes:
