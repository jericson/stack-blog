Remember our [League of (web) Justice?](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/)

Well, I'm pleased to announce we have recruited another superhero into our league: **[Doctype](http://doctype.com)**.

[What is Doctype?](http://doctype.com/about)





>
Doctype is a free question and answer site for web designers. You can get fast solutions to your CSS, HTML, web design and email design problems.

> 
> 
For each question, **Doctype can generate screenshots of your design on any browser or email client**. This makes it much easier for other people to see the problem and help you fix it.






Doctype was _inspired by_ Stack Overflow, but **it was custom-built and tailored to the needs of web designers** by the fine folks at [Litmus](http://litmusapp.com/). Litmus is a tool designed to show how your HTML and CSS will render in a variety of different browsers and email clients, so naturally Doctype supports Litmus integration. When you ask those gnarly design questions, in addition to posting raw HTML and CSS, you can _also_ post a set of automatically generated screenshots illustrating the design problem.



Being "inspired by" Stack Overflow, the site also borrows generously from our concepts of reputation, tagging, and markup -- but with their own decidedly designer-ish bent.



While we certainly encourage web design questions involving HTML and CSS on Stack Overflow, it's intended first and foremost for programmers. So if you're a web _designer_, and less of a programmer, you might find a better audience for your question (plus some cool auto-screenshot capabilities) at Doctype.



What does this mean in practical terms?







  * Our /faq will direct designers with pure HTML/CSS web design questions to Doctype, to better serve this subset of our audience.

  * Our “hero roster” at the bottom of every page will officially list doctype.com as a member of the team. 

  * We will host Doctype discussion on meta, so the Doctype [developers](http://stackoverflow.com/users/20345/davidsmalley) can participate and respond to community reactions and feedback for their site. 




While this is a looser, less direct partnership than [the one with How-To Geek](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/howtogeek-and-stack-overflow/), it does align well with our core Q&A; format. By combining forces with How-To Geek and DocType, we're creating an even stronger [Justice League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League) on the web. All the better to serve our central mission: **getting the best possible answers to your questions**. Whatever those questions happen to be.
