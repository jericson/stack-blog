This is the twenty-sixth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, where Joel and Jeff answer five listener questions, mostly about social software design. Warning: this podcast features cowbell. Really.







  * **Christopher Leary**: "Any thoughts on the general design of karma and rep systems based on your experience building one for Stack Overflow?"


  * **Michael L Perry:** "What about a system where votes by people who have more reputation count more?"


  * **Jeff Metzner**: "If I post personal anecdotes as an answer to a question, is it reasonable for other users to edit that?"


  * **Anonymous: **"Why can't we ask IT questions? What about a sister site like Stack Overflow but for IT questions?"


  * **Miles Dennis:** "For a cost-conscious startup, where do you see the balance between taking inexperienced staff that costs less, versus experienced staff that costs more?"
