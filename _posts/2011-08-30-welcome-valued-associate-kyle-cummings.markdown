Born and raised in Florida, Kyle is a third generation alumni from the University of Florida. Needless to say he is a huge Florida Gator fan.  Kyle enjoys traveling with his favorite trips being to Jamaica, Las Vegas and of course to Gainesville, Florida for Gator football games.  Not just a sports fan(atic), Kyle stays active playing rec sports, and spending time outdoors.  While Kyle is still adjusting to the weather “up North”, his favorite thing about New York life is the endless weekend brunch options.

Welcome Kyle!
