As promised, we are slowly rolling out the [third place](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/) across our network... even for _ewoks!_

In addition to `chat.meta.stackoverflow` and `chat.serverfault` we just brought up **[chat.superuser.com](http://chat.superuser.com)**:

It's only appropriate that, after [adding per-site metas](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/new-per-site-metas/), we would also add chat to complete three out of four sites in [the original "trilogy"](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/).

<table cellpadding="4" width="600" cellspacing="4" >
<tr >

<td ><code>superuser.com</code>
</td>
<td >Q&A; for computer enthusiasts and power users
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td ><code>meta.superuser.com</code>
</td>
<td >community organization and discussion about the site itself
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td ><code>chat.superuser.com</code>
</td>
<td >real time chat "third place" for regulars
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Although **[chat.superuser.com](http://chat.superuser.com)** is technically another public beta, we're still on track for releasing chat network-wide in a few weeks. However, **stackoverflow.com will be the _last_ site to get chat** because its immense volume presents the hardest challenge.

We're hoping to get good feedback from chat.superuser [and chat.serverfault](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/server-fault-chat-now-available/) before proceeding onward, so please -- jump in and tell us what you think!
