This is the eighteenth episode of the StackOverflow podcast, wherein Joel and I discuss the following:






  * We finally get to meet Michael Pryor, the [co-founder of Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/About.html), who is a special guest on this episode!

  * Joel had good luck browsing our beta site using [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com/). I'm still incredibly impressed with the [Mobile Safari](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/safari.html) browser on the iPhone, which renders our JavaScript-heavy site perfectly, as far as I can tell.  



  * Joel posted a Regex question on the Stack Overflow beta, and I can't help bringing up [RegexBuddy](http://www.regexbuddy.com/), my favorite (and still best) regular expression tool for developers.


  * Social websites are a bit unpredictable to build -- we intended Stack Overflow as a relatively straightforward question / answer site, but there's quite a bit of demand for inter-answer discussion. Our system is designed to float the best answers to the top via voting, but this makes conversations in the answers difficult to follow.


  * Stack Overflow is a hybrid of a discussion forum, a wiki system, and a voting/reputation system. It's been a hit so far, but we are running into some design issues resulting from this unusual combination.


  * I had the opportunity last week to meet [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/), who Joel and I are big fans of. Joel particularly enjoys their podcast, [You Look Nice Today](http://youlooknicetoday.com/). Turns out Merlin is a fan of Joel's as well. We should form a mutual admiration society!


  * If you'd like to sign up for the Stack Overflow private beta, which will run until the end of the month, [use our Google Docs signup form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pKxDW35algYdxrCnzW-OLag).




We didn't get to any listener questions this episode, but we'll remedy that next time!




If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to [podcast@stackoverflow.com](mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com). You can [record a question](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/recording-podcast-questions-using-your-telephone/) using nothing but a telephone and a web browser.
