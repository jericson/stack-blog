The [logo design contest for superuser.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/logo-design-contest-for-superuser-com/) is coming to a close.



There are a number of solid contenders, and I've already solicited input from the team and friends. But now I want to know what _you_ think. So I put it up to a quick visual poll -- **click through to vote!**
