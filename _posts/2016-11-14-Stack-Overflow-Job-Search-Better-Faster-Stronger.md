Finding a job you love should be easy and hassle-free, which is how we built [Stack Overflow Jobs](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs): Personalized job matches, and no recruiter spam. We’re expanding our promise to users today with even more magic.

Starting today, you can expect...

* **Better filtering options:** Developers can now filter by technologies, salary, experience level, company and industry. 
* **Faster search engine:** When a user runs a search or performs an action, only specific sections of the page refresh, saving a second or two per action.
* **Stronger and more specific job alerts:** More filtering options allow developers to conduct better searches and set more specific job alerts. 
* **Sorting by best matches and salary:** You’ll see the best matches at the top of your search results by default. You can also sort by salary and newest.

# Match Your Stack, Match Your Experience

Work with what you know best. Our new technology filtering lets you to view jobs with tech you want to work with and exclude jobs with tech you dislike.

You can now also filter by range of experience (e.g. student, junior, mid-level, senior, lead, and manager).

# Money, Money, Money & More

We believe job seekers should be empowered with as much information as possible when looking for a job – especially salary. It’s why we [built](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/07/salary-transparency/) and are [always improving](http://stackoverflow.blog/2016/10/international-salaries/) our own [salary calculator](https://stackoverflow.com/company/salary/calculator). And it’s why we want to put salary filtering up front for search. Salary filtering lets you set a minimum annual salary and choose among ten currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, INR, SEK, PLN, CHF, DKK).
