In this episode of the Stack Overflow podcast, Joel and Jeff discuss the Stack Overflow Careers philosophy, online community growth patterns, and how to tell if you're Sid Meier or not.






  * Stack Overflow Careers is now [fully open for business](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/careers-now-open-for-businesses/)! Joel explains what it's all about, the proverbial [programmer search engine](http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/12/02.html).   



  * One thing we have resisted is employer demand for a sort order of CVs by Stack Overflow reputation scores. This is sort of like colleges sorting incoming applications by SAT or ACT scores. We have a brief discussion about how the college admissions process relates (or doesn't) to job "admissions".


  * Joel shares his tips on what makes a CV / resume look good to him. And remember,[ Joel wrote the book on this stuff](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590598385)! So in theory, at least, he knows what he's talking about! Fog Creek does a lot of hiring every year.


  * Now that we have a so-called "Careers" site on Stack Overflow, any perceived crossover between your professional life and online life is 100% intentional and by design -- [as correctly noted by the Cerebral Mastication blog](http://www.cerebralmastication.com/?p=370).


  * I am now required by law to link to [this amazing and hilarious SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454) (on the perils of matching XML with regex) which already has a stunning two thousand upvotes! It went hyper-viral.


  * Should we allow Facebook questions (or other questions specific to a website) on Super User? It's [a bit complicated](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/30475/official-stance-on-facebook-questions-on-su) because websites are becoming legitimate "software applications" in today's computing world, and even more so in the future. The line between a traditional software executable and a website is becoming less and less clear.


  * Discussing how you scale a community on Stack Exchange -- is it about having lots and lots of questions, or garnering a solid audience of experts?


  * There appears to be a distinct difference between the early, adolescent, and mature stages of a community. You have to plan for and adapt to each stage; there is no "one size fits all" approach. I'm reminded of Robert X. Cringely's classic essay [Commandos, Infantry, and Police](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000025.html).


  * Joel's counterpoint is that [maybe you're actually working with Sid Meier](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26064). My counterpoint: everyone _wants_ to think they're Sid Meier, but as in [Highlander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28film%29), "There can be only one".


  * Per Joel, programming is not about knowing a programming language any more than being a concert pianist is about knowing how to read music. But is programming anything like creating art or music?


  * Joel is offering **a free Fog Creek t-shirt of your choice for the best question asked next week** -- so get those (audio only, please!) questions called or mailed in! And leave us a way to reach you.




We answered the following listener questions on this podcast:






  1. **Josh** from Taiwan: "I'm looking to move from QA into programming. Is it better to know one language really well, or lots less well? Also, does Objective-C pass the Joel Test of knowing C?"  






If you'd like to submit a question to be answered in our next episode, record an audio file (90 seconds or less) and mail it to [podcast@stackoverflow.com](mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com). You can [record a question](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/recording-podcast-questions-using-your-telephone/) using nothing but a telephone and a web browser. We also have a dedicated phone number you can call to leave audio questions at **646-826-3879**.
