Pete has been married to his lovely wife Kristy for eight years and they have two sons Nate, 3 and Ben, 1.  An avid gardener, Pete has successfully grown pumpkins, radishes, cucumbers, swiss chard, snow peas and more.  In his spare time, Pete enjoys playing computer games and [guns with George](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/welcome-server-fault-valued-associate-000003/).
