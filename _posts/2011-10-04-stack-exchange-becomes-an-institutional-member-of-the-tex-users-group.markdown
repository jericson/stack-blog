We're pleased to announce that Stack Exchange is now an institutional member of the [TeX Users Group](http://tug.org/instmem.html).

[![TeX Users Group](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXIaX.png)](http://tug.org)

The TeX Users Group (TUG) is a non-profit organization supporting the [the TeX typesetting system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) community -- or anyone generally interested in furthering the fields of typography and font design. It's popular within many academic disciplines, several of which are represented in the [Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com/sites).

TeX was originally popular as a tag on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and eventually grew into its own [TeX Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com) site through the [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com) process. This community has actively [contributed new packages](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1721/1816) back to the TeX community, and maintains a [community blog](http://tex.blogoverflow.com).

As part of our institutional membership, we can also **provide eight members of our TeX community individual memberships**:

This initiative was driven by the TeX Stack Exchange community itself; thanks for helping us make this happen! And if there are any other ways we can assist in [supporting community conferences, associations, or organizations](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/supporting-community-conferences/) don't hesitate to float it on your meta!
