I am beginning the process of placing a **Stack Overflow T-Shirt** order.



Please refer to [the two meta t-shirt questions](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/t-shirt) to see proposed designs (or post your own), but I think we're going to have to go with something simple and basic to please everyone.

At the moment, I am thinking a large-ish copy of the logo on the front of a plain white (but quality!) T. Sort of like the above, minus [Konrad's amusing recursion joke](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/18382/help-design-our-stack-overflow-t-shirts/18398#18398). :)



Yes, there will be Super User and Server Fault t-shirts as well -- and _probably_ black versions of all the above.



If you have experience getting T-shirts printed, please share any tips or recommendations on the process. I do expect our order to be a fairly large one...
