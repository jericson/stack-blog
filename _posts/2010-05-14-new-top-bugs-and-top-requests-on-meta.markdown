Before we [switched to meta.stackoverflow.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/), we used UserVoice to track our bugs and requested features. It had a nice leaderboard of the highest voted items which we treated as a sort of de-facto "to-do" list. We did our best to satisfy the top-rated UserVoice requests and work our way down the list.



While it is possible to manually replicate the UserVoice feature/bug leaderboard on meta by …







  * querying for questions with specific tags, by


    * adding multiple tags using the server-side tag wildcard (~) operator

    * excluding some tags using the not (-) operator


  * sorting by votes




… I thought we should make that easier. A lot easier. So we added dedicated 'bugs' and 'reqs' tabs. Now it's a one-click operation to see **the highest voted outstanding bugs and incomplete feature requests**.

While we are currently all hands on deck for an [imminent public API beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/03/stack-overflow-api-private-beta-starts/), I still believe strongly in following up on what the community believes to be the [most important bugs](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/?tab=bugs) and the [most popular feature requests](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/?tab=requests) and making them a priority.



Bottom line: **if you see anything in the [top bugs](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/?tab=bugs) or [top features](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/?tab=requests) lists you'd _really_ like us to work on, vote for it!** And if your favorite isn't there, [search for it](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/search) and vote it up to get it on that meta leaderboard, and on our radar.
