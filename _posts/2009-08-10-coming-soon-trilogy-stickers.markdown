As mentioned on the [podcast](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/podcast-64/), we're working on [Stack Overflow Trilogy](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/) stickers. I just placed the order with [websticker](http://www.websticker.com), in fact, and here are the proofs:

[![Super User sticker proof](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8uqKL.png)](http://superuser.com)



And because we fully support [members of our League of (web) Justice](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/), I ordered some for our fellow league member, [How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/), as well.

(all stickers are 4 1/2" wide, custom die cut white vinyl, and printed in full color)



These will of course be given out at [Stack Overflow Dev Days](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/), and in other ways that we haven't quite figured out completely yet.
