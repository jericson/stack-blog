I'm pleased to announce that [the employer beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/11/careers-employer-beta-underway/) is now complete, and [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com) is now fully open for business!



[![dilbert-new-employee](https://i.stack.imgur.com/acWft.png)](http://www.dilbert.com/)



The **employers and hiring managers** rates are:







  * 1 week subscription is **$500**


  * 1 month subscription is **$1,000**


  * 6 month subscription is **$3,000**


  * 1 year subscription is **$5,000**





Employers can give our search interface a spin for free, to see total match counts and get an idea of how many candidates they'll be looking at with a subscription. As always, this whole thing is backed by our 90 day no-questions-asked total satisfaction policy. Got more questions? We've documented everything in the [faq](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/faq).

Although November and December are not exactly _banner_ months for hiring, we have a solid stable of employers already using the site -- many of whom were [already participating on jobs.stackoverflow.com](http://jobs.stackoverflow.com/). They're searching through filed CVs, and actively sending messages to candidates that look promising. So keep those CVs in good shape for January!



If _your_ company is hiring top software engineers, I encourage you to **check out [Stack Overflow Careers!](http://careers.stackoverflow.com)**
