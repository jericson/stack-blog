Remember when I talked about [Eating Our Own Careers Dogfood](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/)? Well, that applies to _all_ of our sites, not just Stack Overflow. Including [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/).

I'm pleased to announce we're **expanding our team on the System Administrator side with [Server Fault user Kyle Brandt](http://serverfault.com/users/2561/kyle-brandt)**.

(yes, _technically_ this means Kyle is Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00009, since the actual name of the company is Stack Overflow Internet Services, Incorporated. But I personally prefer to think of him as Server Fault Valued Associate #00001.)



In addition to helping us build out [the bigger, badder New York datacenter](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/633403731/phase-two) and assisting us in keeping our servers and network running smoothly, Kyle will be driving the [Server Fault Blog](http://blog.serverfault.com/). We believe in being as transparent as possible about what we're doing, and how we're doing it -- both by actively participating in Server Fault every day and by contributing information and support to the greater sysadmin community. To that end, Kyle has already published a great new post about [fault tree analysis](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/747186396/serverfault-trees) on his very first day. You can expect more of this in the future.



Will we be doing _more_ hiring from Server Fault? _You bet your sweet RAID arrays we will!_ Stay tuned.
