We're pleased to announce that ubuntu.stackexchange.com, in partnership with Canonical, Ltd, has become [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com).

[![ask ubuntu](https://i.stack.imgur.com/WY4Jh.png)](http://askubuntu.com)

We're excited to see this come to fruition, because:





  * Our mission is "let's make the internet better"; that's strikingly similar in scope to [Canonical's mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Ltd.).

  * It underscores the spirit of both Ubuntu and Stack Overflow in that we can all get along and learn from each other regardless of petty differences like religion technology stack

  * We're big fans of open source software, as demonstrated in [our free vote-based open source house ads](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/free-vote-based-advertising-for-open-source-projects/) and our [yearly donations](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-gives-back/) and even [directly funding open source projects](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/stack-overflow-sponsors-haproxy/).

  * All of our data is released to the community in perpetuity [under Creative Commons](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/)

  * We believe in [regular moderator elections](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/02/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-election-results/) and community self-governance


I have to admit that I voted strongly against [having both Unix/Linux and Ubuntu sites](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/unix-and-ubuntu-why-both/), but I deferred to the overall votes not to merge both inside and outside the company. We collectively said [Fork It](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/fork-it/). It's clear now that given the strength and self-identification of the Ubuntu community, _they are the exception that proves the rule_.

Honestly, we get approached a lot for partnerships like this, but they don't usually go anywhere because we require ceding so much control back to the community. It is rare indeed to find such a complimentary relationship -- and we hope this one is beneficial to Ubuntu, our network, and the internet community at large.

But, as always, **you be the judge**. Be part of the community that governs the site:
