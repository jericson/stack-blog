I will be attending the [Microsoft Professional Developers' Conference](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/) this year, courtesy of Microsoft.

The main reason I am attending is to help [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/) deliver a session about [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/).





## ASP.NET MVC: A New Framework for Building Web Applications

Phil invited me to talk for 15 minutes about the real world use of ASP.NET MVC in stackoverflow.com, and I was happy to oblige him. Phil and I have been friends for a few years, so our relationship predates any of the business stuff.



If you're attending [PDC08](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/) this year, maybe I'll see you there -- and definitely attend our session!



Update: the session Phil and I presented can [now be viewed online](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/). (Thanks Zack!)
