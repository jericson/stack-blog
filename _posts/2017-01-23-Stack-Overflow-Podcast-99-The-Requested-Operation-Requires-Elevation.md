We actually have 2 sponsors for today:

Grace Hopper - A program of Fullstack Academy. The Grace Hopper Program is an immersive software engineering course for women. Students only pay tuition once they secure a developer job after the program. Visit The Grace Hopper Program at [www.gracehopper.com](http://www.gracehopper.com).

Girls Who Code - A national non-profit organization dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology. They create a stronger community around girls and women that will empower the next generation to be leaders in technology. Visit [www.girlswhocode.com](https://girlswhocode.com/).

In today's episode, Joel complains about Excel on Mac, the hosts play Start Up or Shut Up, and  surprise! The One Minute Tech Review is NOT about light switches.

This week's Developer Story is new Stack Overflow data scientist and literal rocket scientist, Dr. Julia Silge. She tells us about her [Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)) into programming, starting in high school with LAN parties and continuing with her tech-adjacent foray into physics and numerous post-doctorals (with the dynamics of galaxies, nbd) before starting with Stack Overflow. She has written a blog post, that came out last week, titled "[Women in the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/01/women-in-the-2016-stack-over-survey/)" where she analyzes the data from last year's survey that focuses on how women answered the questions and what are some of the characteristics specific to women on Stack Overflow. There are some surprising differences between the way men and women answered the questions.

"One of the things that I am really most excited about, being at Stack Overflow... is having such amazing data about the worldwide community and the people who work with code and software."

This week's SO Constitution question: **Is it grammatically correct to say "Data is‚Ä¶" or "Data are‚Ä¶"?** Listen to the opinions of the hosts, and then post your answer to Twitter using the hashtag #stackoverflowpodcast, along with your explanation. Keep it short, but clever! The funniest explanation, whether winning or losing, will be read on next week's podcast and win an awesome Stack Overflow Sticker. Last week's winner, answering the question: PRO or CON: Is it sufficient to close a bug as NOT REPRO or do you have to write an explanation?

"@StackPodcast always explain ... that's the point of SO after all." - [@racascou](https://twitter.com/racascou/status/821118491642253312) 

Congrats raf√¶lcastrocouto, you win stuff!

We also need new amendments, so tweet us your ideas and we could name an amendment after you! Seriously, we need ideas. Give us some, please.

Thanks for listening and see you next week for our **100th episode special with @codinghorror, himself, the one and only Jeff Atwood!** 

Editor's note: American cheese is delicious! Period.
