Thanks to our good friends at [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/), **we now support native image uploads on all [Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com) websites**. 



![](/images/wordpress/native-image-uploads-imgur.png)



Yes, that means adding a picture to a question or answer is now as easy as ...







  1. clicking the **Insert Image** ![](/images/wordpress/insert-image-button.png) toolbar button 

  2. selecting an image from your computer, or the web

  3. clicking **Upload**




... there is no step 4, you're done!



These images are kindly hosted by [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/).

Alan Schaaf, the man behind Imgur, generously provided us a network-wide "pro" account that keeps any images hosted through our websites around indefinitely.



We're also using Imgur's [brand spanking new API](http://api.imgur.com/) to implement this feature. I've been using Imgur on and off for a while, as it was arguably already the best free image hosting service on the internet -- and [with the new API, it just got even better!](http://imgur.com/blog/2010/08/17/the-most-requested-feature-of-all-time-has-arrived/)





Ever since [Imgur accounts](http://imgur.com/register/upgrade) were released, people have been asking non-stop about the ability to upload into their accounts by using the tools. Your request did not go unheard. Today, I’m pleased to announce the new Imgur API, which not only includes support for uploading into accounts, but also includes support for managing every aspect of your account.

Here are just a few of the things you can do:

>   * Upload images anonymously

>   * Upload images into accounts

>   * Create and manage photo albums

>   * Delete images

>   * List all images in your account

Don’t worry if you’re a not a technical person and you don’t care about what an API is. What it means is that, very soon, you will have access to many more tools that enable you to upload into your account from your desktop, mobile phone, iPad, etc.









We think native image hosting is pretty crucial to some upcoming Stack Exchange sites like [photo.stackexchange.com](http://photo.stackexchange.com) and [ui.stackexchange.com](http://ui.stackexchange.com). Thanks to Alan and Imgur for helping us make it happen for everyone!
