I'm proud to announce that [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com) is now **the official network hub for the entire Stack Exchange 2.0 network!**



[![](/images/wordpress/stackexchange-new-homepage.png)
](http://stackexchange.com)



Thanks to the herculean contributions of team members [David Fullerton](http://stackoverflow.com/users/91687/david-fullerton) and [Emmett Nicholas](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2749/emmett-nicholas), our shiny new network hub contains:







  1. A list of the **[most interesting questions _right now_](http://stackexchange.com)**, across the entire Stack Exchange network

  2. A directory, with statistics and rankings, of **[all public sites in the Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)**

  3. A **[per-site user reputation league](http://stackexchange.com/leagues)** for all Stack Exchange websites




But how do you know you're on a Stack Exchange 2.0 network website?



Why, I'm glad you asked!



Just check for **the genuinetm Stack Exchange logo in the upper left hand corner**. If you see that, you can be sure it's the real deal, and not some brand-x knockoff site. Better yet ... _click it!_

That's right, stackexchange.com is now _so awesome_ that **every one of our sites carries a wee mini pocket version of it along with them**, like a kangaroo with a joey in its pouch.



And that's not all. We've also rolled out something that's been requested for a very long time: **Reputation Leagues**.

For any Stack Exchange website, you can see **monthly, weekly, and quarterly reputation league user rankings**, along with velocity (change per time interval). This strictly a _for fun_ feature -- it's meant as a friendly, informal way of tracking your reputation on a particular Stack Exchange site. (Not that these reputation leagues won't inevitably become a bloodthirsty fight to the death, but hey -- I tried. It really is just for fun and stats junkies!)



I'm proud to finally have a network anchor site worthy of the name. We're still in the process of adding many more features, performance tweaks, and bugfixes to [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com), but it's a promising start, and a major milestone toward our overall Stack Exchange 2.0 network vision.



Enjoy!
