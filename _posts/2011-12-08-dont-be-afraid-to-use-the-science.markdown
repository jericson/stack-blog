I saw an [interesting Battlefield 3 question on gaming](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/37051/what-is-the-range-of-the-eod-bot) a few weeks ago. 

> I've recently unlocked the EOD bot, and while playing around with it (and being hopelessly ineffectual with it) I've noticed that after I have driven a certain distance away I will return back to first-person view. Running towards the EOD bot will allow me to take control of it again. **How far can I drive an EOD bot away from me before I lose control of it?**

I play Battlefield 3! Extensively! I've used the remote control EOD bot before, but I have no idea what its maximum range is. I've never lost control of it. So I _could_ have answered ...





<blockquote>
When I play as Engineer, I've never lost control of the EOD bot. Are you sure you're not doing something wrong?
</blockquote>





... and that is true, insofar as my in-game experience goes, but it's kind of my opinion, isn't it? I was curious myself. How would one figure out the actual range of the bot? I decided the only way to _definitively_ answer this question was to:







  1. Start Battlefield 3

  2. Pick the biggest map I knew of

  3. Spawn as an Engineer

  4. Deploy the remote control EOD bot

  5. Drive the bot as far as I possibly could




So I did. Which took a solid 15 minutes of my time at least. After doing this I belatedly realized that _I had just run a science experiment_.

**Stack Exchange just trolled me into doing _actual science_.** For a freaking _game_. Wow. Consider the implications. Now, if only we could harness those powers for something useful, right? Well, take a look at [this Super User question](http://superuser.com/questions/364949/does-a-computer-use-less-resources-when-programs-are-minimized). 





<blockquote>
When programs are minimized in Windows 7, do they use less memory and CPU than leaving them maximized?
</blockquote>





The highest voted answer has an official Microsoft Knowledge Base article backing it up, but it's quite old. Other users dispute whether it's correct or not. Anecdotally, I've read other blogs confirming the behavior described in that MSKB, but a long time ago. At least that answer _has_ a citation backing it up; many of the other answers on the question are little more than opinions. And you know what they say about opinions. Opinions are like ... _beautiful flowers_, everyone has their own favorite. 







Super User is a technical site for computer geeks; we should be able to do better than a bunch of opinions and a smattering of links. A _lot_ better. As a fellow Super User, I decided the best way to tell what's going on here was to ...







  1. Start a common program

  2. Do something typical in it

  3. Check Task Manager or Process Explorer to see how many resources the program is using

  4. Minimize the program

  5. Check Task Manager or Process Explorer to see how many resources the program is using




... so I did. And I edited the highest voted post to include the results of my little science experiment.

While we don't come out and say it quite this way\*, **the best answers -- not just on Stack Exchange, but to _any_ question in life -- should probably involve a little bit of science.**
