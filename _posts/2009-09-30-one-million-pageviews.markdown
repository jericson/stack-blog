A small, but arbitrary milestone in Stack Overflow history:



Per Google Analytics, we finally did **one million pageviews in a single day** on Tuesday, September 29th.

After flirting with hitting this limit all month (so many golf crowd "awww" near-miss moments), we were finally rewarded with 1,015,756 pageviews yesterday, just barely squeaking it into [the month of September](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/2613465918).



As a point of comparison, when [Stack Overflow launched to the public a little over a year ago](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/then-a-miracle-occurs-public-beta/), on September 15th, 2008, we did about 750k pageviews on the 16th with all the launch publicity in full swing. But once that died down, the site quickly normalized to about **300k pageviews** on a typical weekday. 



So in about a year:







  * traffic has more than tripled

  * the site has grown from one server to three (database, web1, web2)

  * over 300k questions 

  * over 120k real, [_active_ users](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/when-is-an-account-abandoned/)

  * we've launched twothree other sites in [the trilogy](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/)


    * [serverfault.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-launches/) (May 26 2009)

    * [meta.stackoverflow.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/cmon-get-meta/) (June 28 2009)

    * [superuser.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/super-user-now-public/) (Aug 18 2009)





It's been a great year, but I suspect the next 12 months will be even better! We have some exciting announcements planned for [DevDays](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/), so stay tuned.
