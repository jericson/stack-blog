Remember our [logo design contest for stackoverflow.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/04/logo-design-contest-winner/)? And the [logo design contest for serverfault.com](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/logo-contest-winner-for-serverfaultcom/)?



Well, it's time to [bust out your copies of Microsoft Paint](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxx2KcPWWZg) and rev up those mad [MacPaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint) fat bits skillz, because **we just launched [a logo design contest for superuser.com](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/details)**.



You remember superuser.com -- it's the [third site in the Stack Overflow trilogy](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/), intended for **power users and computer enthusiasts**. If your question is about computers, it's fair game on superuser.com.



But this time, in the interests of mixing things up and keeping it fresh, we're trying out [crowdspring.com](http://www.crowdspring.com/) as the contest host.

Also, we amped up the rewards to make sure the designers who win (or at least come close!) get something reasonable for their efforts:







  1. winner: **$768**

  2. runner-up: $200

  3. runner-up: $200




So if you have design skills, please [read the contest design brief](http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/logo_for_superuser_com/details) -- and help us construct an awesome logo for superuser.com!
