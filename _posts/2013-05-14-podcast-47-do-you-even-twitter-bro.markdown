We're Back!  It's been a while since our last podcast (why you ask - listen to find out!) but we're back now and "stronger" than ever.  It's Joel, David and Jay (plus producer Alex and Abby) coming to you from the brand new SE Podcast Studio (check out the picture below)



	
  * News of the day: we're finally in our new office (and podcast studio). We've got hexagonal offices (and therefore crooked hallways), and a cool café area. AND HEATED TOILET SEATS. And a kitchen with a giant walk-in refrigerator, for our interns (which we don't have).

Taping podcasts in our new "studio"!



	
  * The new office has a nice event space. We've even done an event in it already!

	
  * Last week, we had all of the remote developers, sysadmins, community managers, and sysadmins fly into New York to come hang out in the new office. We ate sushi and fried chicken and played a lot of ping pong, and also got some work done.

	
  * Originally, we had planned these summits to be our Main Decision-Making Time, which ended up working terribly. We need to be able to make our decisions and do our brainstorming with remote team members regardless of whether or not they're in the office.

	
  * Jay, what's happening with the Stack Exchange sites? We closed a couple of small sites - [Arduino](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49538/arduino) and [Big Data](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/40518/big-data). Everything on Arduino could have been discussed on [Electrical Engineering](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/) anyway.

	
  * We may have the same problem with [Network Engineering](http://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/) (currently in private beta), but we're more optimistic about that site. Likewise, we shut down [Big Data](http://bigdata.stackexchange.com), but currently have [Open Data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/) in private beta. Learn more about why one will survive where the other languished by listening in.

	
  * Next topic: do tags belong in titles? Joel: "No." Jay: "You're wrong." (there's a bit more to it)

	
  * This is a good discussion! You can weigh in in the podcast comments!

	
  * David, do we have any new features? Check out our sites in an incognito window to see some stuff you may have missed.

	
  * We'll be debuting the new Help section soon! Previously, we've had all of our FAQ/help/how-to information spread far and wide across the network sites and their metas. No longer!

	
  * Also, we're working on some mobile apps. They're vaporware at this point.

	
  * Related: [we're hiring](http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring)! Devs, front-end developers/designers (which is it?), community managers, sales people… everything.


That's our show! Thanks for listening to Stack Exchange Podcast #47. See you in two weeks!
