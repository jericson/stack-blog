Welcome to the Stack Exchange Podcast, recorded Tuesday, August 2 at our headquarters in NYC. This week’s episode is brought to you by peanut butter, the tasty legume paste Americans spend $800 million on each year, as well as by our actual sponsor, IBM. [Try the new IBM Cloud Tools for Swift.](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=podcast) 

This week, our usual hosts Joel, Jay, and David are joined by Stack Overflow engineering manager Matt Sherman, [who recently led the launch of our salary calculator](https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2016/07/salary-transparency/). If you’re interested in working at Stack Overflow, or you just want to know how much our engineering, design, and product roles make according to years of experience and skill level, the salary calculator offers transparency into our compensation methodology. 

Comments about the calculator were split on Reddit and Hacker News between us paying too much and us paying too little so… we’re doing it right? The gang goes deep on developers’ problems with salary negotiations, and they share an epiphany about the meaning of the classic board game, Monopoly, that they probably should have realized years ago.

As is now officially tradition — because there’s been two of them in a row — we have another One-Minute Tech Review from Joel for you. This week’s review is of Google Flights, where you can search for cheap flights in seconds. Will David throw shade on his review again? As is now also tradition, perhaps. 

Finally, Jay talks about [our recent decision to stamp out use of the term “rep-whore” in the community](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/281787/it-s-time-to-retire-the-term-rep-whore). From now on, “rep-whore” will be treated like any other term that’s inconsistent with Stack Overflow’s [“be nice” policy](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice): it will be removed. 

If none of this is your cup of tea, make sure to listen anyway just to hear Joel tell a joke about the pluperfect tense. Memorize it and make sure to reuse at the next grammarian cocktail party you attend.
