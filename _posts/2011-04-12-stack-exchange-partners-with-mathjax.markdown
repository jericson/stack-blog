I'm pleased to announce that [Stack Exchange is now a major supporting partner of MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/sponsors/).

[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cgNag.png)](http://www.mathjax.org)

MathJax is, of course, an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all modern browsers. It's a joint project of the American Mathematical Society, Design Science, Inc., and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

We love MathJax, and we use it on six sites in [the Stack Exchange network](http://stackexchange.com/sites) so far with great success:



>
**[Quantitative Finance](http://quant.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for finance professionals and academics

>
**[Electronics Design](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for electronic hardware hacking enthusiasts

>
**[Statistical Analysis](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for statisticians, data analysts, data miners and data visualization experts

>
**[Physics](http://physics.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for active researchers, academics and students of physics

>
**[Mathematics](http://math.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for people studying math at any level and professionals in related fields

>
**[Theoretical Computer Science](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/)**
Q&A; for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields




It turns out math is kind of ... important ... to a lot of the hard science communities. _Who knew?_

We were thrilled to be able to apply some of our [VC unicorn dollars](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/03/a-new-name-for-stack-overflow-with-surprise-ending/) toward making MathJax a great open source tool for rendering math in web browsers -- **not just on our communities, but across the whole of the internet**. That's our fundamental mission: to make the internet better for _everyone_.

It is quite an honor to be on the sponsors page alongside organizations like [Project Euclid](http://projecteuclid.org) and [The American Physical Society](http://www.aps.org/). That's the kind of company I am very happy to keep. 

If you'd like to test out math notation on one of our sites, refer to a [LaTeX2 mathematical notation reference](http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/) and remember that `$$` and `$$` are the delimiters that indicate when you enter and leave LaTeX2 mode.

Pause a few seconds for the real-time preview to kick in and see what kind of math you've wrought in your answer. Or, just view MathJax in action on the existing Q&A; at [quant](http://quant.stackexchange.com/), [electronics](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/), [stats](http://stats.stackexchange.com/),  [physics](http://physics.stackexchange.com/), [cstheory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/), and of course [math](http://math.stackexchange.com/). Click the edit link (recently made [available to all users](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/suggested-edits-and-edit-review/)) on any post to see the underlying markup.

Enjoy! We'll be working closely with the MathJax team to fold back in any feedback, enhancements, or improvements we come up with for the greater math community.
