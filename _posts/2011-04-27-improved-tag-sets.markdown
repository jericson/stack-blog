Earlier this month, Emmett [asked for feedback](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/87239/suggest-the-next-feature-for-the-stackexchange-com-master-website) on what we should improve next on [stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com).

The consensus seemed to be that the existing functionality was good, but it could be simpler to use -- as expressed by Pekka:



<blockquote>
I miss the carefully crafted minimalism that I've come to love so much on SO. From that perspective, stackexchange.com is not yet doing as well as I would expect from what is the public face of the network, and its official headquarters. I don't have a clear idea of what needs to be done, but I would like to see the site taking a more intuitive and beginner-friendly approach to exploring the network.
</blockquote>



Nowhere is this more apparent than Tag Sets, which [we originally rolled out last November](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/tag-sets-on-stack-exchange/). Tag sets are actually an _incredibly_ powerful feature, but the UI for it ... uh, not so good. 

We rolled up our sleeves and built an all new, _much_ friendlier interface. We also renamed it to something that's hopefully a bit clearer: **filters**.

There are also two new built-in, default filters available for every network user:





  1. **My Sites** -- all questions on every site that you have an account on

  2. **Favorite Tags** -- all questions on every site in the favorite tags you've selected on those sites


[Filters](http://stackexchange.com/filters) (n√©e Tag Sets) are a perfect way to follow activity on tags across the whole Stack Exchange [network](http://stackexchange.com/sites), either in the browser or via email subscriptions. If you tried it before and were flummoxed by the UI, **[please do give it another shot and let us know what you think.](http://stackexchange.com/filters)**

Oh, and don't forget [you have a network profile](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/stack-exchange-network-profiles/) at stackexchange.com, too.
