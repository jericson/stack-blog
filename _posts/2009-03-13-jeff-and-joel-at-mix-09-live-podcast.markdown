Joel and I will be at the upcoming [MIX 09](http://2009.visitmix.com/) conference in Las Vegas next week.

More specifically, **we'll be doing the Stack Overflow podcast _live_ from the show!**



**Tuesday, March 17**, 2009, at **6:30 PM**
At the **Third Place** hang out area
The Venetian Las Vegas
4th Floor, Marcelo 4403



You _will_ need to be registered for the conference (which takes place at the Venetian). You do _not_ need to be registered for the workshops.



This is technically the day before the conference begins, but if you'll be there, do stop by! I know Joel is bringing all kinds of crazy audio equipment for lots of audience participation.



**Geoff Dalgas and Jarrod Dixon from the Stack Overflow team will also be present for the duration of the conference**, so if you spy them walking around the Venetian, feel free to strike up a conversation with them and grill them on any aspect of SO. I grant anyone reading this full permission to monopolize their time. :)



If you can't attend the conference, as a perk for those viewing remotely over the web, there's also a [brief 30 minute online-only Q&A; after the keynote](http://visitmix.com/News/Watch-MIX-Online-Ask-the-Gu) with Scott Guthrie (aka "The Gu") and myself. I believe we'll be taking questions through the Twitter #askthegu hashtag. And with any luck I'll have nothing to say because the Gu has more programming knowledge in the tip of his pinky finger than I have in my entire body.
