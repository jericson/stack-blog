Scott Hanselman's [article about keyboard shortcuts and web sites](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheWebIsTheNewTerminalAreYouUsingTheWebsKeyboardShortcutsAndHotkeys.aspx) reminded me that I inexplicably forgot to blog about **our very own [totally awesome set of keyboard shortcuts for Stack Exchange!](http://stackapps.com/questions/2567/official-keyboard-shortcuts)**

[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OCK7y.png)](http://stackapps.com/questions/2567/official-keyboard-shortcuts)

While we haven't yet integrated keyboard shortcuts into the core site, the [Stack Exchange Official Keyboard Shortcuts](http://stackapps.com/questions/2567/official-keyboard-shortcuts) browser script _is_ explicitly supported and actively maintained by us (mostly through the hard work of [Ben](http://stackexchange.com/users/40051/balpha) and [Rebecca](http://stackexchange.com/users/60791/rebecca-chernoff)).

If you're a website keyboard type of guy or gal, give it a shot. There's a nice, friendly tag wiki on [how to install browser scripts on the Stack Apps scripts tab](http://stackapps.com/tags/script/info), but for convenience I've included the direct links to install below:





  * [**click HERE to install with update check**](https://bitbucket.org/balpha/se-keyboard-shortcuts/raw/tip/sekeys.updating.user.js) - regularly checks for an updated version of this script and notifies you if one is available. Requires `localStorage`.


  * [**click HERE to install without update check**](https://bitbucket.org/balpha/se-keyboard-shortcuts/raw/tip/sekeys.user.js)



After installing (and possibly restarting/refreshing), pressing ? should get you started.

There are lots of other [cool Stack Exchange scripts](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/stack-apps-and-scripts/) on Stack Apps, and of course we have a full-blown API for accessing Stack Exchange sites that [just went to version 2.0](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/stack-exchange-api-v2-0-no-longer-beta/). Check 'em out!
