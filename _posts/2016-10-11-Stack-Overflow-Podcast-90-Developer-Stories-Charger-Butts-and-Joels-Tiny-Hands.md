Welcome to The Stack Overflow Podcast #90, recorded October 3 at Stack Overflow Headquarters in NYC. This week’s podcast is brought to you by the [QWERTY keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY): "Since 1878, it's not so bad!" Enough said. The podcast is also brought to you by Thinkful. [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/?utm_source=podcast_blog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=thinkful_Oct) provides coding education with one-on-one mentorship. Rated #1 Coding Bootcamp by Course Report with over 6,000 students mentored.

In this episode: Rant Soup™, now with Trello! If you would like to make your own Trello board of rants, or soup, go to [Trello.com](https://trello.com/). Also, according to Joel, Jay is still not getting a raise. (Don't worry buddy, you'll get there someday…)

Today's special guest, calling in from not-so-sunny London, is Stack Overflow PM Kit Karrau. Kit is the driving force behind our new product, the Developer Story, launching today. Developer Story shows what you’ve built, not just where you’ve worked or went to school. It’s your story; tell it your way. Go to [s.tk/story](http://stackoverflow.com/users/story/join) to create yours now.

As part of our favorite story about a developer in this week’s episode, we learn that Joel's hands are very small in a certain photo on a certain [website](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelspolsky) (so you should definitely NOT go there right now to point and laugh).

In the News this week, the gang finds out that developers rant the most about product managers, and that AI is going to put tax preparers out of business.

It's also the third week of the Stack Overflow Constitution. Vote on this week's amendment: When you are at the supermarket, should you be able to eat an item BEFORE you get to the cash register? Listen to our hosts' points of view and then tweet to us using #StackOverflowPodcast: PRO if you think that you SHOULD be able to eat it before you leave the store (and pay for it at the register using the wrapper), and CON if you think that you SHOULD NOT, along with a brief explanation. The best answer will be read on the air next week, and by best, we mean which one made us chuckle the most.

Last week's winner is Michael Berkowski with a great tweet story culminating with:

"My request was denied, so I got to learn a little French instead #StackOverflowPodcast" - [Michael Berkowski, @mberkowski 9:33 AM - 3 Oct 2016](https://twitter.com/mberkowski/status/782981953737805824)

See you next week!
