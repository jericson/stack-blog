I recently had a [long discussion](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/1455/what-is-the-point-of-help-me-remember-this-game-questions) on gaming meta regarding "Help me remember this game" questions. I'll spare you all the gory details; my general conclusion was this:





<blockquote>
If we get an excellent user who asks a <em>good, thoughtful</em> [game] identification question and sticks around in our community to participate, then it's worth allowing it in those rare cases as a high quality "getting to know you" fun question.
</blockquote>





This reminded me of a conversation I once had on [Server Fault Chat](http://chat.serverfault.com) about `mod rewrite` questions. This is a true gray area in our network. It's tricky, because any given URL rewriting question could legitimately be on topic for multiple sites, each with a different core audience:







  * [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com) (sysadmins)

  * [Stack Overflow](http://stackexchange.com) (programmers)

  * [Webmasters](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com)




I don't think a black and white "all URL rewriting questions belong on {site}" ruling would be helpful in these gray areas. What matters most is **the _context_ of the question**. You need to use your judgment to look at the bigger picture around the question: is this person a system administrator? a webmaster? a programmer? Even the 'same' URL rewriting question can have different solutions depending on which audience it's being presented to.



That's why I recommend considering these gray area questions in the context of the _user_. **Does this user _belong_ here on this site with us?** Or is it the guy in the nerdy suit who just walked into the biker bar?

[Pee-Wee Herman walks into a noisy, rowdy, crowded biker bar. He puts a coin in the pay phone and begins dialing.]

>
Pee-Wee:
What? I'm sorry, operator. I can't hear you. [turns to the bikers, yelling in exaggerated fashion] _Shhh!_ I'm _trying_ to use the phone!

>
[The bikers all grow quiet and circle around Pee-Wee at the pay phone. The lead biker hangs up the phone.]

>
Biker:
Did anybody tell you that this is the private club of the Satan's Helpers?
                   
>
Pee-Wee:
Nobody hipped me to that, dude!   
                   
>
Biker:
It's off-limits!
           
>
Pee-Wee:
Oh. Well, _my mistake_. Ha ha! Guess I'll be on my way, then! Ha ha!

>
[Pee-Wee tries to innocently exit, pushing his way gently outward against the tightly grouped circle of bikers surrounding him.]

>
Pee-Wee:
Excuse me! Excuse me. Ha ha! _Excuse_ me! Excuse me.






(There's no way I can do this brilliant scene justice in text, so you should [watch the clip on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVKsd8z6scw). This is of course from the timeless movie [Pee-Wee's Big Adventure](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/).)



Anyway, my point is this: when you have to make judgment calls about questions in the gray area of mildly off-topic -- **apply the Pee-Wee Herman Rule!**







  1. If you have reason to believe, based on the context, quality, and content of the question, that this user could potentially be a positive contributor to your community -- I'd be inclined to let their question stay.

  2. If you have reason to believe, based on the context, quality, and content of the question, that this user would _not_ be a positive contributor to your community -- I'd be inclined to close the question, or migrate it somewhere else where they'd fit in better.




This is not meant to be an exclusionary rule. It's more of a general measurement of how committed new users are to at least _trying_ to fit in to the community they just walked in to. As Pee-Wee proved, being the nerdy guy in the biker bar can work -- so long as you're willing to dance the Tequila song with us.
