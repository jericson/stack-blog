We think books are a great conversation starter and reveal a lot about one’s natural curiosity. So, we’ve added a “bookshelf” to your [Careers 2.0 profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/books)!

 

It’s all about telling **the story of your professional development**. Perhaps you deftly implemented an [Observer pattern](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIIBINOD46VC3JCLQ%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0201633612) for a chat application. Maybe you educated your manager about the [maker’s schedule](http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIIBINOD46VC3JCLQ%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1449389554). Heck, maybe you _wrote_ a book, or several.

We are also providing better guidance to help you develop a more thorough profile. Look for the “completeness” widget in the upper right:

…which leads to a clear explanation of what your next steps might be. This comes straight from the feedback employers give us about what they want to know.

 

As you may know, Careers 2.0 profiles are [invitation-only](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/careers-2-0-launches/). You might receive an invitation based on your activity on Stack Overflow, or through a peer who has been granted some invites of their own. You can [request an invitation](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/get-one), too.

 

_PS, One of our valued associates created a _[_labor of love_](http://alikewise.com)_ on a similar “books” premise, but with slightly different goals._
