For as long as we've been working on Stack Overflow, we've been telling people that **web search is our "homepage"**. Just to prove it, I dug up our old **Project Ask Elevator Pitch** from [FogBugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/) -- and it's right there at the top:

![Don't try to replace forums. Answer people's questions! That's our focus. Get those answers to the top of Google search so people can find the information they're looking for with a minimum of noise. How will people arrive at the site? 1) Google -- ideally directly to the question and answer.](/images/wordpress/project-ask-elevator-pitch2.png)

We've been beating this drum since the day the project began. Our goal is to make the internet better by building an engine that surfaces the _best_ content to search engines.

Of course, searching a _single site_ like Stack Overflow with Google (or your favorite web search engine) is plenty easy. We even have helpers on the [search page](http://stackoverflow.com/search) to assist:

Doing it manually isn't hard, either; just enter the `site:` operator in front to scope your search to just a single site.


    
    
    <font color="maroon">site:stackoverflow.com</font> find these words
    



Which is fine, but what happens when you have [an (awesome) trilogy?](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/) Or when you suddenly have [24+ (awesome) websites](http://stackexchange.com/sites)? Then ... it's not so easy to search them all.

Until now!

We just added a custom Google search for _all_ of our sites at the top of [http://stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com).

[![stack exchange search all sites](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HnIUW.png)](http://stackexchange.com)

So you can now express and share network wide searches like so:





  * [http://stackexchange.com/search?q=the+center+cannot+hold](http://stackexchange.com/search?q=the+center+cannot+hold)

  * [http://stackexchange.com/search?q=how+do+I+back+up+my+website](http://stackexchange.com/search?q=how+do+I+back+up+my+website)

  * [http://stackexchange.com/search?q=move+the+turtle+in+logo](http://stackexchange.com/search?q=move+the+turtle+in+logo)


... and so on.

We'll keep this up to date as we launch new sites, so you can **use your favorite search engine as the de-facto front end for all of our websites.**

Exactly the way we always intended.
