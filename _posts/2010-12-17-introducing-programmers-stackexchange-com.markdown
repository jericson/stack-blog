One of the [more popular Stack Exchange beta sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites) just came out of beta with a final public design:



## [programmers.stackexchange.com](http://programmers.stackexchange.com)



[![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZLAR.png)](http://programmers.stackexchange.com)

Now watch closely as I read your mind.



## I don't get it! What's the difference between Programmers and Stack Overflow?



I'm so glad you asked!

In a nutshell, **Stack Overflow is for when you're front of your compiler or editor** working through code issues. **Programmers is for when you're in front of a whiteboard** working through higher level conceptual programming issues. _Hence the (awesome) whiteboard inspired design!_

Stated another way, Stack Overflow questions almost all have **actual source code in the questions or answers**. It's much rarer (though certainly OK) for a Programmers question to contain source code.

Remember, these are just guidelines, not hard and fast arbitrary rules; refer to the [first few paragraphs of the FAQ](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) if you want specifics about what Programmers is for:



>
Programmers - Stack Exchange is for expert programmers who are interested in subjective discussions on software development.

>
This can include topics such as:


> 
> 

>   * Software engineering

>   * Developer testing

>   * Algorithm and data structure concepts

>   * Design patterns

>   * Architecture

>   * Development methodologies

>   * Quality assurance

>   * Software law

>   * Freelancing and business concerns







_Editorial note: the FAQ guidance has changed significantly over the years to better reflect the sorts of conceptual questions that actually **work** - please refer to [the latest version in the help center](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) before asking._



Although I fully supported this site when it was just [a baby Area 51 site proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3352/not-programming-related), we've endured a lot of angst over it -- mainly because **it veered so heavily into the realm of the subjective**. It forced us to think deeply about what makes a _useful_ subjective question, which we formalized into a set of 6 guidelines in [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/). Constructive subjective questions …
 




  1. inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.


  2. tend to have long, not short, answers.


  3. have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.


  4. invite sharing experiences over opinions.


  5. insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.


  6. are more than just mindless social fun.



Ultimately, with a little extra discipline and moderation, I think the site turned out great. So, go forth and ask your **high level, conceptual, software development questions** on [programmers.stackexchange.com](http://programmers.stackexchange.com)! Just make sure they're [professional and constructive](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective), please - refer to [help center](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for more guidance there.
