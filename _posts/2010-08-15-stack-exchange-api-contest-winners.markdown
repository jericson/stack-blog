After nearly two and a half months, our [Stack Exchange API contest](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/) is officially over. In that time, our community created [85 applications](http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/app) and [24 libraries](http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/library). 



It was tough judging winners between so many fantastic entries. I  encourage you to [browse the complete list of apps and libraries](http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/app+or+library) to see for yourself how much cool stuff the community created. Whatever your platform of choice, there's something here for you to work with, learn from, and perhaps even contribute back to.

We've contacted all the winners via email and we'll be arranging shipment of your prizes ASAP. Additionally, anyone with an entry in the contest that had 3 or more score at the time of judging was sent a Stack Overflow, Server Fault, or Super User t-shirt of their choice -- and naturally [a bunch of stickers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/how-to-get-stack-overflow-stickers/).

**Congratulations to everyone who entered the contest.** Your feedback helped us drive the API forward and make it better for everyone -- but most importantly, _you built amazing apps and libraries!_

You guys rock. And, yes, keep your eyes peeled for Stack Exchange API 2.0 sometime next year.
