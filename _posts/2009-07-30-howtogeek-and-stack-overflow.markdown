Remember the [League of Justice](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/) I said we were forming?



Well, I'm thrilled to announce that our League has added its **first new superhero**: the [How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/).



[![how-to-geek-logo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZc0V.png)](http://www.howtogeek.com/)



I've been a fan of [The Geek's site](http://www.howtogeek.com/) since the very first time I discovered it in late 2007. It's a fantastic resource filled with great content, and _just_ the right tone. I knew he had a massive success on his hands from day one, and I've had an off-and-on email correspondence with Lowell (aka The Geek) long before Stack Overflow was anything more than a gleam in Joel's eye. This has been in the works for a while.



The Geek is truly one of us. He's a programmer who had a Stack Overflow account since the beginning ...







... _and_ he can [solve a Rubik's cube in 3 minutes](https://twitter.com/howtogeek/status/2926027208).



Like us, Lowell believes in **the power of getting good content out on the web** and in the hands of the community -- and _always_ in a clean, ethical, web-friendly way.



That's why I am proud to announce our official affiliation. Starting today:







  * Lowell will be an [active moderator](http://superuser.com/users/4102/the-how-to-geek) and participant on [Super User](http://superuser.com), helping drive the direction and content of the site.

  * Our "hero roster" at the bottom of every page will officially list howtogeek.com as a member of the team.

  * [How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/) will act as the 'editorial content' yin to [Super User](http://superuser.com) 'user-generated content' yang, in order to complement and support each other.




This partnership is tremendously exciting to me. By combining forces into our own little [Justice League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League) on the web we hope to not only help each other grow, but also to deliver great _justice_ to the web, together, in the form of first-rate content and community!



Any [evil](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001246.html) we defeat along the way will, I'm sure, be completely coincidental ...



oh, and stay tuned for _another_ superhero we're recruiting into our League over the next months..
