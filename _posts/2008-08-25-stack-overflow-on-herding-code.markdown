I was invited to participate in [the latest Herding Code podcast](http://herdingcode.com/?p=36). 



[![herding-code-logo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXKQ0.png)](http://herdingcode.com/?p=36)



This was a fun one for me because I've known the four hosts of the program -- [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway), [Kevin Dente](http://weblogs.asp.net/kdente), [K. Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/), and [Scott Koon](http://lazycoder.com/) -- through their blogs since forever, eventually meeting most of them in person. All of their blogs predate mine by years. I'd almost say we were _blog buddies_. If you could call people _blog buddies_. Which I don't think you can.



At any rate, **I go into quite a bit of technical depth on Stack Overflow and some of the features that we have yet to implement, but have been hotly requested** -- definitely worth a listen if you want to go deep.



Thanks for having me on!



(oh, and listen past the end for a little audio easter egg that's sort of fun)
