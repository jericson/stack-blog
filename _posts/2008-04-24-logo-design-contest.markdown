The name stackoverflow.com was [partially chosen by the community](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001095.html), with stackoverflow.com winning by a virtual landslide.



But websites can't survive on name alone. We also need a logo. A logo with verve. With zazz. With moxie! A dynamic logo that reflects the potential of this mythical programming community site we're building.



Rather than try out my anemic design skills -- it's always dangerous when programmers start thinking they're designers -- I thought I'd put the logo design to the community in similar fashion. We have [a stackoverflow.com logo design contest at 99 designs](http://99designs.com/contests/6774), with a prize of $29 at stake.

I've been quite impressed by many of the [submissions](http://99designs.com/contests/6774) so far. The contest runs for another five days, so if you're interested, please submit a logo!
