Welcome to The Stack Overflow (yes Overflow, listen to last week!) Podcast #89, recorded September 27 at Stack Overflow headquarters in NYC. This week's installment is brought to you by [Inuktitut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut), the premiere language of the arctic and one of [Nunavut's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut) three official languages ([Umiaryuap Publimaaqpaga tattaurniq ammayaq!](http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/hovercraft.htm)) as well as National Voter Registration Day. Go to [www.voteplz.org](http://www.voteplz.org) for the easiest way to register! "Every individual regardless of wealth or heritage has the same opportunity to vote and create real honest change."

In this episode, Joel complains about things. How is that different from the other podcasts, you say? This time there's singing.

Our hosts also talk about a few recent blog posts concerning the declining quality of Stack Overflow while trying very hard, and failing, to not quote the first U.S. presidential debate. Jay and Joel break down what these posts got right, what they got really wrong, and what we can learn from them in our mission to make Stack Overflow a better resource for the world's developers. (Disclaimer: no [Kewpie](http://texasdolldesigns.com/images/kewpies/bunnyhop.jpg) dolls were harmed in the making of this podcast.)

Speaking of the debate: Both candidates had something to say about tech, and we can't let that go without at least discussing the yuge problem of using "cyber" as a noun. Check out this week's “In The News” for this and much more, including hearing David ask "Grandpa Joel" to tell him more about the Xerox Alto.

Also, it's the second week of our new feature (not a bug!): the Stack Overflow Constitution. Vote on this week's amendment: Should programming languages count toward your college language requirement? Listen to the podcast to see where our hosts stand and tweet at us to weigh in yourself. Use the hashtag #StackOverflowPodcast and give us your Pro or Con with a brief explanation. The best answer will be read on the air next week, and by best, we mean which one made us laugh.

Last week’s winner, commenting on whether socks should go on before pants or pants before socks, was Bryan Bedard, who said

"Con. I tried to put socks on before pants but got an InvalidOperationException #StackOverflowPodcast" - Bryan Bedard, [3:53 PM - 26 Sep 2016](https://twitter.com/BryanBedard/status/780601304154386432)

See you next week!
