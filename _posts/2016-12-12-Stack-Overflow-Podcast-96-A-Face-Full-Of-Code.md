Welcome to the Stack Overflow Podcast #96 recorded on December 8, 2016 at the Stack Overflow headquarters in the jackhammer capital of the world (probably), NYC. Today's podcast is brought to you by the [Pizza Saver][1], otherwise known as the small table thingie that keeps your pizza from sticking to the top of the box. It is also brought to you by [IBM Watson][2]. What does a world with IBM Watson look like? With Watson, the world is getting healthier, safer, cleaner, more creative and even more personal. That's cognitive that matters. Welcome to the IBM Watson world.

For today's shenanigans, we are so lucky to have guest host (as well as new [Fog Creek CEO][3] and close friend of Stack Overflow) Anil Dash, who rightfully mocks Joel's recent keynote at Slush 2016 in Helsinki. If you watch the video [here][4], you will understand this reference:

Thanks [@balpha][5]

Joel and Anil talk about the past, present, and future of Fog Creek and it's ties to the origins of Stack Overflow and Trello, as well as the amazing new [GoMix][6] (formerly Hyperdev) app building software. So what's been the hardest part of taking over Fog Creek? Figuring out where to sit in the lunchroom every day during mandatory lunches! Duh. Seriously though, culture is such an important part the company's success and Anil is committed to preserving that culture so that Fog Creek can continue to ["help ordinary people make extraordinary things on the Internet."][7]

Along with Anil we have special guest Dr. Dave Robinson, data scientist at Stack Overflow, discussing a few of his recent popular blog posts concerning [analysis of software developers in New York, San Francisco, London and Bangalore][8], (over 60k views) and the now infamous [analysis of Trump's Tweets][9] (over half a million views in the first week!). We apologize in advance to Android users. I'm sure you're not all angry…

This week's constitution question: Is it pronounced GIF with a hard G **/ɡif/** or GIF with a J **/jif/**? I can't believe that we are opening this can of worms, but hey, the world is crazy right now, so why not? Post your answer to Twitter using the hashtag #stackoverflowpodcast, with either PRO if yay, or CON if nay, along with your explanation. Keep it short but convincing! The funniest explanation, whether winning or losing, will be read on next week's podcast and win a fabulous STACK OVERFLOW STICKER. We also need new amendments, so tweet us your ideas and we could name an amendment after you!

Last week's winner, with an answer to the question, "Is it ok to get a mechanical keyboard with loud 'clicky' keys when you are sharing an office?" AKA The Punyon Amendment, is Brian with:

>"PRO because they shouldn't be able to hear the keyboard over my trap music."   
>-[@TheBestHuman][10]

Congrats Brian, you won a thing!
