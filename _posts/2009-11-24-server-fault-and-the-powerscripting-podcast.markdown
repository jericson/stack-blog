I was invited on as a guest of the [PowerScripting Podcast](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/) last week for show 93. That show is [now live!](http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/episode-93-jeff-atwood-tells-us-rock-hard-awesome-will-create-teleportation-and-we-talk-about-serverfault/)

I'm a huge fan of [PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell), which is one of the most innovative scripting languages out there.  It's a sort of post-modern, truly next generation scripting language where you're piping actual objects-as-text around instead of mindlessly grepping text. I swear it actually manages to out-UNIX UNIX. In my humble opinion, anyhow. But I digress!



It was a fun podcast, and particularly illuminating for [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com), since PowerShell itself is rather emblematic of the grey area between Stack Overflow (programming) and Server Fault (system administration).



Anyway, if you have any interest in scripting languages whatsoever, I encourage you to [check out PowerShell!](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx) It's good stuff!
